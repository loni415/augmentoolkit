### President Xi stressed that people's war will always be our magic weapon to defeat the enemy.Judging from several recent local wars and armed conflicts, hybrid warfare that comprehensively uses political, economic, military, diplomatic, public opinion, and legal means has begun to emerge, causing profound changes in the connotation and extension of war, and has become a new trend in the evolution of war forms and a new focus of strategic games among major powers. How to effectively respond to hybrid warfare, better play the unique advantages and powerful power of people's war, and develop people's war strategies and tactics in a targeted manner is an epoch-making proposition that must be deeply explored and answered.

Expanding from“military” to“global”--

### Recognize the new position of people's war

### People's war is a great initiative of our Party in leading the people and the army in the practice of China's revolutionary war. The key to why people's war has become our magic weapon to defeat the enemy is to continuously promote the innovative development of content and methods based on the changes in war forms and needs, centering on maximizing the advantages of war's justice and broad mass participation. Against the backdrop of major changes in today's world, hybrid warfare aims to respond to complex and changing security threats and challenges. It is characterized by the mixing of war subjects, war styles, war means and combat purposes, and triggers a chain reaction in the field of confrontation. War has evolved from“military dominance" to“multi-faceted mixing” and from“military confrontation" to"full-domain confrontation". Grasping the epochal changes of this war, promoting the expansion of people's war from“military” to“full domain”, and recognizing the new era positioning from the perspective of“full domain confrontation” are the inevitable choices to keep pace with the times and exert the overall power of people's war.

It should be noted that the people's war under modern conditions is still a war of the whole people with close coordination on the political, economic, military, scientific and technological, and cultural fronts.This is in line with the diversity of forces participating in hybrid warfare to a great extent, highlighting the contemporary value and unique charm of the people's war. At the same time, the global nature of the battlefield space and confrontation methods of hybrid warfare requires the people's war to add new contemporary connotations, form a display form, application scope, and coverage area that are adapted to it, and more fully reflect the comprehensiveness and thoroughness of the people's war.

First, we will achieve full-domain cohesion through national mobilization. We will adapt to the expansion of battlefield space from traditional land, sea and air to new domains such as space, network, electromagnetic, and cognitive domains, and expand the confrontation methods from traditional fields such as politics, economy, diplomacy, and military to emerging fields such as finance, law, energy, and public opinion. We will promote the full-domain national defense mobilization, continuously enhance the integration and coordination of the whole domain, and the degree of system integration, and gather the main forces of the people's war in all fields, dimensions, and all directions.

Second, we should achieve the best in all areas through overall coordination. We should coordinate development and security, economic construction and national defense construction, strengthen the integration of strategic layout in various fields, the integration of strategic resources, and the integrated use of strategic forces, improve the mechanism for matching national defense needs, promote the coordinated development of key and emerging fields, strengthen strategic planning, resource input, and force pre-positioning in new security fields, make full use of and absorb high-quality resources and forces in various fields and aspects, and form a new pattern of people's war with efficient coordination, close connection, and the best in all areas.

Third, achieve victory in all domains through national defense of all people. Establish the concept of all-domain total warfare from the level of strategic planning and war design, and with the support of the increasingly powerful national comprehensive strength, deeply tap the war strength and potential of national defense of all people, promote the deep integration of military with economic, political, cultural, social, scientific and technological fields, realize centralized decision-making, cross-border coordination, and synchronous control of multiple confrontations, comprehensively improve the comprehensive ability to deal with various security threats, and firmly grasp the strategic initiative of people's war to confront and win in all domains.

### Extending from“supporting the front” to“direct access”--Grasping the New Characteristics of People's War

The masses are the source of strength to defeat the enemy. Mobilizing and organizing the masses, relying on and arming the masses are the fundamental premise and solid guarantee for winning the people's war.“Everything for the victory of the front”, the people's war has created a successful example of mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of the people to actively support the front in practice. The boundaries of hybrid warfare are more blurred, the war styles are more complex, the participants tend to be diversified, the ways of participating in the war are more diversified, and the battlefield of comprehensive competition and game is“directly connected", which provides a broad stage for the implementation of the people's war.Innovating and developing the“supporting the front” model of the people's war, especially promoting the extension from“supporting the front” to“directly connected”, and grasping the characteristics of the times of the people's war from the perspective of"directly connected to the battlefield" is the only way to give play to the unique advantages of the people's war.

The essence of people's war is to take the masses as the main body, unite the will, wisdom and strength of the masses, and use flexible strategies and tactics to achieve the goal of deterring and winning wars. Hybrid warfare integrates military and non-military actions, direct and indirect actions, and blurs the boundaries between military and civilian, peace and war, which lowers the threshold of war, moves the gate forward, and radiates to a wider range.Combat operations no longer rely solely on the army and soldiers. Government organizations at all levels, various social groups, and people from all walks of life can become participating forces in certain forms or channels; combat methods are no longer limited to various weapon platforms, and related civilian facilities and public platforms such as finance, law, media, and the Internet are integrated into the combat system. This makes the people's participation in the war more diverse and their role more direct, and the people's war's national effectiveness is more prominent.

First, we need to build a national defense mobilization pattern that connects to the battlefield. Facing the diversified battlefields of the future, we need to innovate the system, mechanism and operation mode of national defense mobilization, strengthen cross- military, cross-departmental and cross-regional coordination, open up work links, promote the deep integration of the national defense mobilization system with the national security strategy system and the joint combat system, and accelerate the formation of a military-civilian integrated emergency response system. Wherever battlefield confrontation and game unfold, national defense mobilization will extend to that place, and joint combat, joint training and joint protection will be promoted to that place, reshaping a new form of national defense mobilization that directly connects to the battlefield and focuses on war.

Second, develop a strategic and tactical system of universal support for the war. Adhere to the principle of “you fight yours, I fight mine", focus on using "ability" to defeat"inability", comprehensively use military and non-military, traditional and non-traditional, conventional and non-conventional means, cleverly combine combat styles, coordinate and compound strikes across domains, focus on the center of gravity and accurately release energy, innovate new tactics that reflect the winning mechanism and gather people's wisdom and strength, form asymmetric advantages against major opponents, explore"the higher the road, the higher the devil", and enhance the mass, systematic and creative nature of the people's war strategy and tactics.

The third is to build a national defense reserve force with diverse functions. We will fully adapt to the needs of national security and war, optimize the layout of national defense reserve forces, and build a reserve force team with comprehensive qualities, complex professional skills, diverse functions, focused efforts, and the ability to fight well in special battlefields in the fields of economy, diplomacy, science and technology, finance, network, public opinion ,psychology, and law, so as to raise the construction of national defense reserve forces to a new level.

### Leaping from“assisting in the battle” to“empowering”--Opening up a new path for people's war

"The deepest source of the power of war lies in the people." This winning strategy of the people's war has new and richer forms of expression and ways of realization under the new era conditions, especially under the impetus of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial revolution. Relying on the rapid development of information and intelligent technology, hybrid warfare has made a qualitative leap in high-tech content, which has enabled the use of scientific and technological means to rise from“assisting the war” to“empowering”,running through the entire link and process of the war, and becoming a key factor in gathering and releasing the energy of war. Adapting to the trend of increasingly high-tech warfare, promoting the leap of scientific and technological means from“assisting the war”to“empowering”, and focusing on“scientific and technological empowerment” to open up new paths for the realization of the people's war are key and strategic moves to win the people's war in the new era.

Science and technology are the primary productive forces and the core competitiveness of modern warfare. In terms of enhancing the country's war strength and capabilities, relying on the people and relying on scientific and technological progress are inherently consistent. The more developed science and technology are, the more advanced the war form is, the more urgent the need to transform scientific and technological strength into war capabilities, and the more obvious the decisive role of the people's extensive participation is. Today, with the widespread application of high-tech technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things in the military field, the role of“scientific and technological empowerment" has become more and more apparent, and has spawned new war styles and combat methods, shining brightly in the battlefield confrontation of hybrid warfare.Only by keeping a close eye on changes in science and technology, changes in war, and changes in opponents, making full use of the scientific and technological resources and strength of the whole society, and deeply tapping the war power hidden in the people in"scientific and technological empowerment",relying on the people to enhance the hard- core strength to win the science and technology war, can we ensure that we will take the initiative and gain advantages in dealing with hybrid warfare.

First, gather the power of“empowering” innovation. Strengthen the traction of war preparation needs, put scientific and technological mobilization in a prominent position in national defense mobilization, aggregate wide-area intellectual resources, scientific and technological innovation industry resources, and superior technical resources to carry out more extensive, more precise, and more lasting scientific and technological mobilization. Formulate a strategic plan for military-civilian collaborative innovation with overall, long- term, and forward-looking significance, build a platform for all-round efforts to promote military-civilian collaborative innovation, increase the integration of scientific and technological innovation resources, force integration, demand matching, and achievement transformation, and enhance the scientific and technological support of the people's war with high potential, high quality, and high efficiency.

Second, enhance the overall effect of“empowerment”. Firmly establish the concepts of“big system”,“big integration” and“big collaboration”, break down the barriers of“civilians joining the military” and“military to civilian” from the perspectives of policies, systems and operating mechanisms, open up channels for the two-way transformation of scientific and technological innovation results, focus on the transformation and application of innovative and breakthrough results, maximize the integration of the military with the people and the use of the people for the military, and comprehensively enhance the radiation, penetration and driving force of“scientific and technological empowerment”.

The third is to strengthen the collaborative research of“empowerment”. We should focus on the strategic focus of independent innovation in national defense science and technology, actively seize the strategic commanding heights of scientific and technological innovation, and strengthen the joint development and collective wisdom research of key areas, emerging areas

and key technologies. Aiming at the shortcomings of military struggle preparation and the bottlenecks of weapon equipment development, we should strengthen the cross-integration of disciplines and technologies, and cross-border energy release, promote the supply of high-tech forces, especially“smart+” technologies, continuously empower the construction of information-based and intelligent combat platforms, the construction of new domains and new qualities of combat forces, and the transformation and upgrading of combat systems and combat capabilities, and enhance the quality and effectiveness of scientific and technological innovation in empowering national defense and military construction.

### Expanding from“wrestling” to“accumulating momentum”--Creating New Advantages in People's War

War is a contest of comprehensive national strength, and also a competition of the willpower and strategic planning of both sides. Although hybrid warfare is nonlinear, complex, open and unpredictable, it is“dispersed in appearance but concentrated in spirit, dispersed in form but united in strength"; it is not a separate struggle or simple superposition of various“wars”, but a systematic aggregation based on interaction and winning mechanism, and a total war that accumulates war potential in a larger scope, wider field and higher level. Focusing on transforming strong comprehensive national strength into national strategic capabilities, transforming extensive social forces into overall national defense capabilities, and transforming strong economic strength into actual war capabilities is the powerful potential advantage of people's war. It is an important strategy to consolidate and improve the integrated national strategic system and capabilities to comprehensively plan the national war strength and potential, promote the expansion of people's war from“struggle” to“accumulation of momentum",strive to create new advantages to defeat the enemy, and accumulate new potential for national defense in the new era.

Those who observe the situation are wise, and those who control the situation win. From the perspective of war,“momentum” refers to the macro- control and strategic planning of the overall situation of the war, and plays a decisive role in the competition of war forces.The power of people's war lies not only in“stopping war with force” but also in“relying on momentum to contain war"."Accumulating momentum" means accumulating momentum to effectively respond to hybrid warfare, to contain war and win war, and to seek“defeating the enemy without fighting".

First, create a favorable situation. Adapt to the new requirements of the national development strategy and security strategy, implement the military strategic policy of the new era, innovate the strategic guidance of people's war, make full use of China's unique political advantages, institutional advantages, development advantages and opportunity advantages, strengthen the strategic planning and comprehensive use of various forces and means, and create a more favorable internal and external environment and strategic situation for achieving national strategic goals. Fully grasp the time and situation, danger and opportunity, comprehensively manage crises, actively resolve strategic pressures and risks, take the promotion of the development of the struggle situation as the basis for active defense, form a favorable competitive situation, and firmly grasp the initiative in international strategic competition and real military struggle.

Second, optimize the overall deployment. Overall operations should be carried out to prepare for war and stop war, safeguard rights and maintain stability, deterrence and actual combat, and the advantages of people's war should be integrated into all links and the entire process of deepening military struggle preparations. Efforts should be made to achieve the close coupling of national strategic competitiveness, social productivity, and military combat effectiveness, and to build an overall strategic deployment that is overall coordinated, military-civilian integrated, integrated in peacetime and wartime, and far-reaching. Coordinate the response to traditional security threats and the maintenance of security in new areas, the development of traditional power struggles, and the creation of new power advantages, and enhance the integration, systematication, and innovation of strategic deployment with strong organizational mobilization, overall coordination, and strategic execution capabilities.

The third is to form a winning momentum. Seize the moral high ground, inspire and unite the will of the people across the country, release the firm determination to defend national sovereignty and security, and create a strong momentum and momentum to win the people's war in the new era. Give full play to the unique advantages of the militia and the people, organize and participate in the struggle for rights protection, anti-terrorism,stability maintenance and security, intelligent operations and network defense operations, improve the joint action capabilities of the military and the local areas, build a strategic force system that effectively deters and defeats the enemy, transform the country's strategic capabilities and national defense strength into a powerful deterrent, form a strategic chain of assessing the situation, planning the situation, deploying the situation, creating the situation, and seizing the situation, and build a steel Great Wall of the people's war in the new era.
