### Abstract

Since the United States and the People's Republic of China(PRC) will likely have a competitive relationship for years to come, it is important for US forces to better understand the People's Liberation Army(PLA), both as a competitor below the threshold of armed conflict and as a potential adversary should deterrence fail.

This report--the second in a series--provides the US Army with basic information about how the PLA thinks about the issue of doctrine and some of their key guiding concepts for the application force at the strategic and operational levels of conflict.

### Executive Summary

The United States and the People's Republic of China(PRC) will likely have a competitive relationship for years to come. It is therefore important for US Armed Forces to better understand the People's Liberation Army(PLA), both as a competitor below the threshold of armed conflict and as a potential adversary should deterrence fail.

This report discusses PLA doctrinal issues.

The PLA, like the US Military, develops doctrine to serve as a guide to the application of military force. Both militaries receive national-level guidance for the development and use of military force at the strategic level, and both develop operational-level doctrine.

The PLA and the US Military differ significantly in their approaches to doctrine. The US Military acknowledges that doctrine provides valuable“official advice” on“what works best” in military operations but emphasizes that the military commander's judgment is paramount in all situations. In the PLA, by contrast, doctrine is more directive in nature. Compared to the US Military, the PLA is more dogmatic in its approach to the use of doctrine. Once formulated, PLA doctrine is codified in regulations that the PLA is expected to follow, although PLA professional writings increasingly emphasize situational battlefield initiative.

Several enduring concepts have long influenced the PLA's approaches to the application of military force at the strategic level of conflict:

● Active Defense. This concept stresses defensive actions at the strategic level and offensive actions at the operational and tactical levels. Active Defense does not rule out the use of preemptive attacks if Beijing believes a conflict is imminent.

● People's War. The PRC's approach to armed conflict will entail a whole-of-society response that mobilizes large numbers of both military and civilian personnel and equipment to support the war effort.

● No First Use. China has a No First Use nuclear policy that declares its intent to employ nuclear weapons only in response to another country's nuclear attack on China and not to employ nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear country. The PRC is currently engaged in major efforts to modernize its nuclear forces. Because of this, there are questions about how long China's No First Use policy will remain in place.

### PLA doctrine is being driven by a conception of modern warfare that has the following characteristics:

● Joint operations

● Multi-domain battle spaces

● Information-driven and precision-focused combat

● Whole-of-nation resourced.

Four core PLA operational concepts associated with this view of warfare are listed below(with PLA terminology in italics):

● Integrated Joint Operations emphasizes increasingly integrated operational planning and execution at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels across multiple services, battlespaces, and domains.

● Full-Spectrum Operations, also called“All-Domain Operations,” calls for developing joint and expeditionary capabilities for fighting in traditional domains(land, sea, and air) and emerging domains(outer space, cyberspace, electromagnetic spectrum, and cognitive).

● Multi-Domain Precision Warfare seeks to use military information networks equipped with advanced big data and artificial intelligence(AI) to identify key adversary vulnerabilities and organize PLA joint force kinetic or nonkinetic precision strikes against those vulnerabilities.

● Military-Civil Fusion seeks to increase coordination and integration between the civilian economy and the armed forces to maximize efficiencies in both sectors by reducing barriers to civilian support for military modernization, operations, and activities.

The PLA conceives of several broad types of conflicts, as listed below(with PLA terminology in italics):

● A large-scale defensive war against foreign aggression would involve China's defending itself against an armed attack by one or more“hegemonic countries” that seek to“delay or interrupt China's rise."

● A“large-scale, high-intensity, anti-secession war”would consist of political and military efforts to“safeguard national unity.” One example of this type of conflict would be PLA operations to coerce Taiwan's unification with the PRC by use of military force.

● Medium- to small-scale“counterattack operations” include responses to potential conflicts regarding China's claims to disputed islands or disagreements on the delineation of China's land borders with other countries.

● Small-scale, low-intensity operations include operations to counter terrorism, protect access to key shipping lanes, and defend PRC nationals overseas.

The PLA has developed concepts for a variety of potential operations and activities. Some are tailored to specific services or domains. Others depend more on civilian support. Operations and activities involving large-scale ground force participation are listed below(with PLA terminology in italics):

● Strategic projection and strategic deployments include the long-range delivery of strategic forces and materials via vehicles on land.

● Strategic assaults aim to destroy important enemy targets to weaken the enemy's capacity to wage war and create favorable conditions for the PLA's own strategic offensive.

● Strategic blockades seek to disrupt or deny the enemy's contact with the outside world and thereby weaken its combat capability and war potential.

● Border defense operations seek to maintain the security and stability of border areas or annihilate and expel enemy forces that seek to invade PRC territory.

● Island operations are joint operations conducted by elements of the PLA Army and other services to seize control of“important islands” such as Taiwan.

The PLA Army is modernizing itself to meet the challenges of modern warfare. It has taken steps since 2015 to develop capabilities to execute its full range of ground force missions, including the following:

● Downsizing the force by approximately 600, 000 PLA Army billets to shed nonessential, non-combat units.

● Reducing the number of headquarters to streamline command and control relationships.

● Shifting from a division-centric to a brigade-centric structure in a bid to improve the maneuverability and employment of forces for diverse missions.

● Training for long-distance deployments, with an eye toward becoming capable of quickly projecting power both domestically and internationally.

● Developing new capabilities, including expanding and upgrading aviation, special operations, and electronic warfare capabilities by fielding new equipment such as fixed-wing uncrewed aircraft systems, soldier exoskeletons, and jamming systems.

### 1\. Introduction

\[The PLA must\] have a firm grip on issues concerning war and operations to advance innovation in military theory. Build an advanced system of operational theory that embodies our military's characteristics and conforms with the laws of modern warfare. Continually open up new frontiers for the development of China's contemporary Marxist military theory.

\-Remarks by Xi Jinping during a 2018 inspection of the Academy of Military Science, the PLA's premier institution for development of military doctrine

Since the United States and the People's Republic of China(PRC) will likely have a competitive relationship for years to come, it is important for US Armed Forces to better understand the People's Liberation Army(PLA), both as a competitor below the threshold of armed conflict and as a potential adversary should deterrence fail.

This report-the second in a series-provides the US Army with basic information about how the PLA thinks about the issue of doctrine and some of their key guiding concepts for the application force at the strategic and operational levels of conflict. Evolving doctrine has been essential to the modernization of the PLA as a“world-class military.”

This report explores PLA doctrine, with a focus on the following topics:

● Comparisons of how the US Military and PLA approach the issue of doctrine

● Enduring PRC strategic concepts for the employment of force

● PLA views on likely future conflicts and operations the PLA may be required to conduct

● Evolving PLA thinking on the nature of modern conflict and associated doctrinal concepts.

### 2\. The PLA develops and uses doctrine

In this report, we define military doctrine broadly as high-level guidance on the preparation and application of military force at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of conflict.

Both the United States and the PRC provide their militaries with national-level guidance for the development and use of military force at the strategic level, and both militaries develop operational-level doctrine. In the US, such top-level guidance is laid out in nested documents, including the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and National Military Strategy. PRC leaders issue similar guidance to the PLA in“military guiding thought”and“military strategic guidelines.”

Both the US joint force and the PLA conceptually divide warfare into three levels and have developed doctrine to guide the application of military force at each level. The US divides warfare into the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. The PLA divides warfare into analogous levels(war, campaigns, and battles), each with corollary operational guidance(strategy, campaign methods, and tactics).

### US official advice vs PLA directive regulations

At the operational level, there is a significant difference between how the US Military and the PLA approach the role of doctrine.

The US considers doctrine from the perspective of operational art. Operational Art refers to a cognitive approach in which commanders and staffs-supported by their own skills, knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment-organize and employ military forces for application in strategies, campaigns, and operations. The US Military acknowledges that doctrine provides valuable“official advice” on“what works best” in military operations, while also emphasizing that the judgment of the military commander is paramount in all situations.

The PLA, however, is more dogmatic in its approach to the use of doctrine. In the PRC, military doctrine is codified in regulations. These regulations are considered directive in nature, although situational battlefield initiative is increasingly emphasized in PLA professional literature.

The PLA derives its doctrine through“military science,” which PLA officers consider to be the empirical study of rules and guidelines for war. As Marxists and“scientific socialists,” PLA officers who develop doctrine consider themselves to be using“scientific methods" to identify the“laws” that govern military operations: using empirical observations, developing and testing hypotheses, and running experiments(field exercises and simulations, etc.). Even their key organization for doctrinal development is called the Academy of Military Sciences. This belief that scientific inquiry can uncover operational truths for warfighting is inherited from the former Soviet Union's military.

One manifestation of this"scientific approach" is the PLA's pursuit of cutting-edge information technologies reliant on big data and artificial intelligence(AI) to accelerate and automate decision-making in combat.

### 3\. Enduring PLA strategic concepts

Certain strategic concepts have endured in PLA doctrine over the decades, even as Beijing has periodically adjusted operational doctrine to reflect changes to leadership perceptions of China's security environment, the nature of warfare, and the PLA's capabilities. Beijing has developed these enduring strategic concepts to explain to the PLA, PRC citizens, and the world the Chinese Communist Party's(CCP) and PLA's views about the application of force at a very high level of strategic discourse.

Three enduring PRC strategic concepts are Active Defense, People's War, and No First Use.

### Active Defense

The concept of Active Defense stresses defensive actions at the strategic level and offensive actions at the operational and tactical levels. Active Defense is both a military operational concept and a political declaration. In essence, Active Defense is the PRC's public declaration that the PRC will avoid initiating hostilities against others but will respond forcefully when China is attacked or assesses that attack is imminent. For example, the PLA might launch defensive counterattacks in response to an enemy act of aggression or preemptive strikes on an adversary that PRC leaders assess is preparing to attack.

### Principles of Active Defense

PLA strategists offer the following principles to describe Active Defense:

“Overall, our military strategy is defensive. We attack only after being attacked. But our operations are offensive.

“Our counter-offensive will not be limited by space or time. We will not put limits on the boundaries of our offensives.

“We will wait for the time and conditions that favor our forces when we do initiate offensive operations.

“We will focus on the opposing forces’ weaknesses.

“We will use our own forces to eliminate the enemy’s forces.

“Offensive operations against the enemy and defensive operations for our own force protection will be conducted simultaneously.

“We will maximize our advantages against opposing forces.”

### People's War

People's War represents a body of strategic thought originating from Chairman Mao Zedong in the 1930s that emphasizes sustained, widespread popular support for PLA operations and activities across the continuum of conflict. Through the People's War concept, the PRC's approach to armed conflict against a strong opponent involving a whole-of-society response that mobilizes large numbers of both military and civilian personnel and equipment to support the war effort.

The CCP originally conceived of People's War as a means for arming and organizing civilians into military support units, local militias, and guerilla units. The intent was to have these civilian units augment the ill-equipped Red Army-which became the PLA after 1949-and help it to defeat its technologically superior adversaries. The tenets and core activities associated with People's War have long since moved away from their origins in guerilla warfare. Still, PLA strategists and PRC leaders continue to call for the refinement of strategy and tactics for People's War as they emphasize preparations for potential future conflicts.

Today, People's War is reflected in some concepts of contemporary warfare, such as military-civil fusion, which we discuss in the next section. The concept of People's War is also reflected in the PLA's national defense mobilization system, which marshals civilian resources in support of PLA operations, including the organization of local militia units for certain operational support functions.

### No First Use

China has maintained a publicly declared No First Use(NFU) nuclear policy since its first successful nuclear weapon test in 1964\. The policy states that the PRC will employ nuclear weapons only in retaliation for a nuclear attack on China. It also claims that China will never attack a non-nuclear country with nuclear weapons.

The stated goal of China's NFU policy“is to maintain national strategic security by deterring other countries from using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against China."15 For many years, this has involved maintaining a survivable second-strike capability intended to dissuade other countries from launching a preemptive nuclear attack on China.

Despite the PRC's remaining publicly committed to NFU, there is a debate in China as to whether the PRC should adjust the policy. According to some PRC authors, global military technological developments in non-nuclear capabilities with strategic effects and tactical nuclear weapons are blurring“the line between conventional and nuclear war.” 18 These developments are diminishing the deterrence value of China's second-strike nuclear capability; hence, so some authors argue, China should respond by upgrading nuclear capabilities, strengthening missile defenses, improving space and cyber capabilities, and reconsidering the NFU policy.

In its 2022 annual report to Congress on China's military, the Office of the Secretary of Defense judged that PRC efforts to increase, diversify, and improve the PLA's nuclear, missile defense, space, and cyber capabilities are strengthening the PLA's“peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces." According to the report, these efforts suggest that China may seek to incorporate a“launch on warning” posture into its NFU policy.

### 4\. PLA conception of modern warfare

### PLA doctrine is being driven by a conception of modern warfare that has the following characteristics:

● Joint operations

● Multi-domain battlespaces

● Information-driven and precision-focused combat

● Whole-of-nation resourced.

Of note, on November 13, 2020, China's official Xinhua News Agency announced that Beijing had issued the Guidelines on Joint Operations of the Chinese People's Liberation Army(Trial). According to a Ministry of National Defense spokesperson, the Guidelines are a foundational document that serves as the“capstone” of the PLA's“combat doctrine system.”of the Guidelines is not public. However, analysis of available information indicates that the document is designed to provide the PLA a force-wide common approach to the PLA's current conception of modern warfare.

### Four core PLA operational concepts associated with this view of warfare that the Guidelines likely address include the following:

● Integrated Joint Operations

● Full-Spectrum Operations

● Multi-Domain Precision Warfare

● Military-Civil Fusion.

### Integrated Joint Operations

Integrated Joint Operations, one of the PLA's key joint concepts, emphasizes increasingly integrated service operational planning and execution across all warfighting domains. As a concept, Integrated Joint Operations represents the primary means by which the PLA intends to operate in future contingencies. PLA doctrinal specialists assert that Integrated Joint Operations will leverage new and emerging information technologies to enable command and control(C2) systems to more fully integrate, not just coordinate, the operations of multiple services across various battlespace domains at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war.

The PLA has spent several decades attempting to develop joint operational capabilities. Since the early 1990s, PLA professional literature has increasingly discussed the need for China's armed forces to become capable of conducting joint(multi-service) operations. The PLA has gone through several rounds of institutional reforms attempting to achieve just that.

Military reforms that began in late 2015 and are still ongoing have brought the PLA closer than ever to achieve this aim. Thus far, these reforms have required the PLA to do the following:

● Reorganize national, regional, and service leadership organizations and redefine their C relationships;

● Restructure the size and composition of PLA services' operational units;

● Reform and reorganize systems for training, professional military education, and military science research; and

● Make significant changes to its policies and regulations, operational doctrine, personnel system, institutional culture, management practices, and governance.

### Full-Spectrum Operations

Full-Spectrum Operations, also called“All-Domain Operations,” emphasizes joint and combined arms operations, mobility, expeditionary capabilities, and the ability to fight in all warfighting domains. The PLA's official newspaper, PLA Daily, defined Full-Spectrum Operations as the integration of capabilities across warfighting domains to generate effects and seize dominance in multiple domains. PRC media sources note that all PLA services are engaged in developing capabilities for Full-Spectrum Operations, though specific interpretations of the concept may vary across services. The concept calls for achieving overall superiority at home and abroad across traditional domains(land, sea, air), as well as“emerging domains”(outer space, cyberspace, electromagnetic spectrum, and cognitive). In Full-Spectrum Operations, PLA forces are expected to increasingly integrate and synchronize their operations across these domains.

### Multi-Domain Precision Warfare

Multi-Domain Precision Warfare is a PLA operational concept under development that combines PLA efforts to operate more jointly across all domains with its growing precision warfare and intelligent warfare capabilities. According to the US Office of the Secretary of Defense, this new“core operational concept” seeks to leverage military information networks with advanced big data and AI technologies to(1)“rapidly identify key vulnerabilities in the US operational system" and then(2)“combine joint forces across domains to launch\[kinetic or nonkinetic\] precision strikes against those vulnerabilities."

Multi-Domain Precision Warfare appears similar in many ways to the DOD concept of joint all-domain command and control(JADC2). A key difference is that JADC emphasizes the warfighting capability to“sense, make sense, and act at all levels and phases of war, across all domains, and with partners"(emphasis added). Multi-Domain Precision Warfare does not appear to envision the PLA conducting operations in a combined or coordinated manner with friendly forces.

### Military-Civil Fusion

Military-Civil Fusion seeks to increase coordination and integration between the civilian economy and the armed forces. This longstanding concept aims to maximize efficiencies in China's security and development strategies by reducing systemic barriers to civilian support for military modernization, operations, and activities.

Military-Civil Fusion was elevated to the level of a national strategy under current PRC leader Xi Jinping. The strategy encompassed six interrelated areas of effort:

● Fusing China's defense industrial base to its civilian technology and industrial base

● Applying innovations in science and technology across the military and civilian sectors

● Cultivating talent and blending military and civilian expertise and knowledge

● Incorporating military requirements into civilian infrastructure and using it for military purposes

● Using civilian service and logistics capabilities for military purposes

● Expanding China's system for national defense mobilization so that it encompasses all relevant aspects of the economy and society for use in competition and war. 

### 5\. Types of conflicts

The PLA has many different ways to classify conflicts.

### Total vs local wars

● PLA strategists use the terms“total war” and“local war” to categorize potential conflicts by their general scope and scale.

● Total wars are large-scale, high-intensity, existential conflicts in which national leaders mobilize military and civilian resources to support the war effort.

● Local wars, in contrast, are small- to medium-size regional conflicts of lesser intensity and with more-limited objectives.

### From large to small scale

The PLA Academy of Military Science(AMS), the PLA's leading center for doctrinal research and development, outlines four types of warfare based on scale.  

● Large-scale, high-intensity, defensive war. In this type of conflict, the PLA must defend China from the aggression of a“hegemonic country,” a likely reference to the United States. This type of conflict could take place following gradual escalation from strategic competition with the hegemonic country or suddenly as a premeditated adversary plot.

● “Comparatively large-scale, high-intensity, anti-secession war.” This type of conflict refers to PLA operations to preserve PRC national unity by forcibly responding to(1) Chinese territories seeking independence from the PRC and(2) any foreign adversary efforts to“interfere” in those operations. While PLA planning for this type of conflict may focus primarily on a formal declaration of independence by Taiwan, it may also envision responses to separatist movements in areas like Tibet and Xinjiang.

● Mid- to low-intensity self-defense counterattack operations on a medium or small scale. This type of conflict consists of smaller-scale engagements against countries on China's maritime or land periphery. The causes of such conflicts could include escalated disputes over contested islands(with countries such as Japan, Vietnam, or the Philippines) or land borders(such as the China-India border).

● Small-scale, low-intensity operations to counter terrorism, maintain stability, or protect rights. This type of conflict includes counterterrorism operations at home or abroad. It also includes efforts to defend against threats to the security of maritime shipping lanes and provide for the security of overseas PRC nationals.

### Levels of military technology

The PLA also uses types of military equipment and technologies that it judges to be decisive in past, present, and future wars to classify types of conflicts. Per the PLA's formulation, any given era has one main form of war, though other types of warfare may continue to be practiced. Different countries' capabilities for waging a certain type of warfare may vary, depending on their individual levels of force modernization.

PLA writings currently discuss three main forms of warfare:

● Mechanized warfare originated in the early 20th century, when platforms of increasing size, range, and lethality replaced the role of human(and animal) strength on the battlefield.

● Informatized warfare began to take shape in the late 1990s, as information technologies created systems architectures linking military sensors, armaments, information, and people. A key objective in the PLA's approach to informatized warfare is to seize information dominance and deny it to the adversary.

● Intelligent warfare is an emerging form of warfare that constitutes an evolution of informatized warfare and emphasizes the employment of AI and autonomous capabilities. PLA writings contend that as warfare becomes faster and more complex, humans will place increasing trust in machines to plan and execute operations, though humans will continue to be the most decisive factor in war.

The PLA views itself as currently in a state in which it is consolidating capabilities for mechanized and informatized warfare while looking to develop technologies and doctrine for intelligent warfare. For some time, the PLA will likely possess a mix of both modern and dated capabilities that are representative of each of the three forms of warfare described above. As a former vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission put it in 2022, PLA modernization should proceed as follows:“mechanization is the foundation, informatization is in the lead role, and intelligentization is the path to follow."

### 6\. Types of operations and activities

The PLA conceives of various types of operations and activities that it may need to execute in support of strategic- or campaign-level objectives in conflicts. Some of these operations and activities are focused on a particular PLA service or warfighting domain. Others describe joint force actions in one or more domains and may entail significant civilian support.

The PLA National Defense University, China's premiere institution for joint professional military education and training, laid out 10 categories of wartime operations and activities in its 2020 Science of Military Strategy(see Figure 1 below).

Figure 1\. Ten categories of PLA warfighting operations and activities

| Operation or activity NDU Science of Military Strategy description | Operation or activity NDU Science of Military Strategy description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Strategic reconnaissance and strategic early warning | Operations using multiple detection means to find enemy strategic deployments, identify threats, and transmit relevant information to end users. |
| Strategic projection and strategic deployment | Operations for the long-range delivery of strategic forces and materials and the arrangement of forces according to established combat plans. |
| Strategic assault | Joint operations to destroy important enemy targets and weaken enemy military strength and capacity, creating favorable conditions for a strategic offensive. Assault force composition depends on primary operational domain. |
| Strategic counter-air raid | Offensive and defensive operations to prevent or mitigate damage from enemy weapons, including long-range interception or preemptive attacks that destroy enemy armaments before they launch or take off. |
| Strategic blockades | Joint operations for cutting off enemy economic and military access to the outside world to weaken its combat capability and war potential. Blockade force composition depends on the primary domain of the blockade. |
| Border defense operations | Operations to maintain the security and stability of border areas or annihilate and expel enemy forces that seek to invade PRC territory. |
| Island operations | Joint operations conducted by elite PLA forces to seize control of"important islands" such as Taiwan or disputed land features in the East or South China Seas. These may rely on civilian support to augment sealift. |
| Sea-mobile operations | Offensive and defensive maritime operations to achieve control over key sea areas or chokepoints, including anti-surface, antisubmarine, and mine warfare. |
| Cyber, electromagnetic, and space warfare | Kinetic and nonkinetic operations to paralyze or destroy key components of adversary national and military decision-making and operational systems. |
| Public opinion, legal, and psychological warfare(also called"three warfares") | Influence operations aimed at shaping public opinion by signaling PRC resolve, building legal justification for PRC actions, and influencing foreign decision-makers. |

Source: Science of Military Strategy 2020, trans. China Aerospace Studies Institute.

Depending on the precise nature of the next conflict that China faces, the PLA may seek to execute one or more of the types of operations and activities listed above. Notably, some of these actions will likely take place prior to the outbreak of armed conflict, including strategic reconnaissance and early warning; cyber, electromagnetic, and space warfare; and public opinion, legal, and psychological warfare. Some of these operations and activities are more oriented toward ground-force participation, including strategic projection and strategic deployment, strategic assault, strategic blockades, border defense, and island operations.

### 7\. PLA Army reforms tied to joint operations doctrine

Like other PLA services and forces, the PLA Army seeks to modernize itself to meet the challenges of modern warfare. As part of PLA-wide reforms that began in late 2015, the PLA Army has taken steps to modernize and transform itself into a force capable of carrying out its full range of ground-force missions. Related reform efforts include the following:

● Downsizing the force. The PLA Army shed about 600, 000 billets in a 2017 force restructuring, bringing its manpower down to just under one million personnel.

● Reducing the number of headquarters. Another major focus of PLA Army reforms included reducing the number of headquarters to streamline C relationships.

● Shifting from a division-centric to a brigade-centric structure. The PLA Army completed a transition to a force structure in which brigades-particularly combined-arms brigades-serve as the “basic combat unit.” The shift to the new structure sought to improve the maneuverability and employment of Army forces for diverse missions.

● Training for long-distance deployments, with an eye toward becoming capable of quickly projecting power both domestically and internationally.

● Developing new capabilities, including expanding and upgrading aviation, special operations, and electronic warfare capabilities by fielding new equipment such as fixed-wing uncrewed aircraft systems, soldier exoskeletons, and jamming systems.

### 8\. Conclusion

The application of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum information, big data, cloud computing, and internet of things is gathering pace in the military field.... War is evolving in form towards informatized warfare, and intelligent warfare is on the horizon.

\-Excerpt from the PRC's 2019 defense white paper, China's National Defense in the New Era  

This report provides basic information on PLA doctrinal issues. No military's doctrine is static, however, and the PLA's thinking on the application of military force at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels will continue to evolve in the years ahead.

Factors that could affect the future development of PLA doctrine include the application of new technologies in military affairs, experiences gained during their own military operations and activities, and lessons drawn from ongoing and future conflicts in other countries.  

● New technologies. The PLA perceives the main form of war as trending toward intelligent warfare, in which machines will perform growing numbers of operational tasks. Future PLA doctrinal development may be shaped by internal debates on which roles must be performed by humans and which can be entrusted to AI and autonomy.

● Real-world experience. The PLA is operating far from mainland China with greater regularity in the context of operations and activities such as peacekeeping missions, disaster relief, noncombatant evacuations, and deterrence patrols. Experiences gained in such settings could influence revisions to PLA doctrine.

● Observations of other countries' wars. PLA reforms since 2015 have drastically reduced the size of China's ground forces while emphasizing the development of capabilities in the maritime, space, and cyber domains. Observation of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, however, may cause the PLA to reevaluate its assumptions about the nature of modern land warfare and the force design of the PLA Army.

● China's own continuing experimentation. The PLA continues to experiment with operational deployments, new technologies, field exercises, training experiments, and other ways to try to innovate and improve the military's capabilities.

2 We employ this definition because, strictly speaking, the PLA does not have a term in its professional lexicon that corresponds to the term“doctrine” as used by the US Military.

According to the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, US joint doctrine provides“fundamental principles” for the employment of military forces toward a common objective, a“common perspective” for planning and executing military operations, and a crystallization of shared views on“what works best.” The US Army notes that doctrine offers a“common professional language” and articulates“desirable traits” for members of a military organization. See Joint Chiefs of Staff,“Joint Doctrine Publications,” Joint Electronic Library Plus, [https://www. jcs. mil/Doctrine/Joint-Doctine-Pubs/, accessed](https://www. jcs. mil/Doctrine/Joint-Doctine-Pubs/, accessed) Apr., 2023; Army Doctrine Publication 1-01, Doctrine Primer.

The PLA does not place its official doctrinal materials in the public domain, as does the US Department of Defense(DOD). However, some, but not all, essential elements of PLA doctrine(fundamental principles, common language, etc.) can be found in the public speeches of military leaders, a defense white paper that Beijing periodically publishes, and professional military journals and materials from institutions of professional military education. See David M. Finkelstein, The PLA's New Joint Doctrine: The Capstone of the New Era Operations Regulations System, CNA, DOP-2021-U-0306430-Final, September 2021, [https://www. cna. org/reports/2021/09/the-plas-new-joint-doctrine](https://www. cna. org/reports/2021/09/the-plas-new-joint-doctrine).

6 The 2020 edition of the PLA National Defense University Science of Military Strategy pledges,“In the future, no matter what type and style of combat operations we carry out, we will still adhere to the Active Defense strategic thinking, that is, under the overall defense situation, use active and powerful offensive operations to achieve the established political goals." See Science of Military Strategy 2020, translated by China Aerospace Studies Institute(CASI),“In Their Own Words,” Montgomery, AL:Air University, 2020,[https://www. airuniversity. af. edu/Portals/10/CASI/documents/Translations/2022-01-26%202020%20Science%20of%20Military%20Strategy. pdf; Xiao](https://www. airuniversity. af. edu/Portals/10/CASI/documents/Translations/2022-01-26%202020%20Science%20of%20Military%20Strategy. pdf; Xiao) Tianliang, ed., Science of Military Strategy, 185.

This idea has not changed significantly since Mao Zedong articulated it in one of his writings on military affairs. Mao once described Active Defense as follows:“If people do not attack us, we will not attack them. If people attack us, we inevitably will attack them." See Mao Zedong, Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong, Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1967, 105.

12 China's 2019 defense white paper, for instance, states that“based on the idea that China's national defense is the responsibility of all Chinese people, China's armed forces give full play to the overall power of the people's war by innovating its strategies, tactics, and measures." The call for improving"strategies and tactics for a people's war"was also included in the report delivered by Xi Jinping to the 20th National Congress of the CCP. In addition, the PLA's Science of Military Strategy describes at length the continued relevance of People's War despite a series of changes and challenges it has undergone in the current era as a result of socioeconomic developments in military affairs.
