# PROJECT EVEREST The Department of Defense epicenter for human-centered strategic art

Project Everest is a strategy design start-up inspired by Andrew Marshall’s call to cultivate comprehensive
understanding of U.S. competitors in pursuit of national security. Project Everest contributes to this vision in two
fundamental ways: by recurrently educating defense professionals on adversaries’ ways of war and by facilitating the
development of novel strategies that achieve competitive advantage over potential adversaries. Founded in 2013, Project
Everest has grown its membership to hundreds, and shaped policy and education campaigns at the national level.

Project Everest tackles two significant national security problems for our nation. First, Project Everest seeks to
invigorate the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs’ 2013 charge to develop an officer cadre with deep regional expertise and to
answer the 2018 National Defense Strategy’s charge to “prioritize developing the intellectual firepower of our
warfighters and workforce via education and training”.

Second, we seek to inject creativity into stale strategy development methods for the Department of Defense, inspiring
novel approaches to competition and warfighting and answering the charge of the 2021 Interim National Security Strategic
Guidance to employ our “full diversity of talents [to] address today’s complex challenges” and “prevail in strategic
competition.” Traditional approaches to strategy development overlook opportunities to understand how a potential
adversary thinks about and plans for competition and war.

We bring together motivated individuals with subject-matter expertise in their primary specialty to interrogate key
strategic issues throughout their careers. Over time, this develops a cadre of high-caliber officers who have a deepened
appreciation of nearpeers’ ways of war and are experienced in thinking through the toughest operational and strategic
challenges. We believe human-centered design and unconventional problemsolving methodologies enable members to
assimilate new knowledge and develop novel warfighting concepts and recommendations to address strategic challenges.

Project Everest was founded by six graduates of the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, who range in gender,
expertise, rank, status, ethnicity, and personality, and who have a shared vision to inspire change in the way our
nation prepares to compete and fight.

# In Their Own Words

The “In Their Own Words” series is dedicated to translations of Chinese documents in order to help non-Mandarin speaking
audiences access and understand Chinese thinking. CASI would like to thank all of those involved in this effort.

In the “In Their Own Words” series, CASI and its collaborators aim to provide Chinese texts that illustrate thoughtful,
clearly articulated, authoritative foreign perspectives on approaches to warfare at the strategic, operational, and
tactical levels.

# Project Everest Comments

The Lectures on the Science of Space Operations (2012) is one of the featured “Military Academic Works of the Academy of
Military Sciences (AMS).” This text presents a topic that is within the PLA Military Science Studies Plan. The text is a
fundamental reference and teaching document written by AMS faculty, with help from the former General Staff Department,
from all Services and Arms, and from key academies. This is a classical teaching material for the science of military
affairs postgraduate education, and it is the first of its kind for the discipline building and comprehensive study of
PLA space operations theory.

In the “Foreign Military Thought” series, the U.S. editors aim to provide foreign texts that illustrate thoughtful,
clearly articulated, authoritative foreign perspectives on approaches to warfare at the strategic, operational, and
tactical levels. The U.S. editors apply a stringent vetting process to select foreign texts. Selected texts will help
build a deep understanding of different approaches to warfare and clarify details of foreign perspectives that may have
both commonalities and asymmetries to U.S. approaches. This series will stimulate thought on both the core elements of
military strategy and operational concepts for force application during war. The editors believe that cultivating a
holistic understanding of foreign perspectives by learning from high-quality original material articulated from a
foreign perspective offers an invaluable starting point for the exchange of ideas and the development of military
thought.

The translation and publication of Service and Arms Application in Joint Operations does not constitute approval by any
U.S. Government organization of the contents, inferences, findings and conclusions contained therein. Publication is
solely for the exchange and stimulation of ideas.

# Translators’ Notes

This translation of the original text aims to accurately capture the technical meanings, in both English and Chinese.
This will ensure that the reader will not inadvertently draw the wrong substantive understanding based on inaccurate
translations.

# Note on Trouble Terms:

Throughout the text are certain terms that are translated with the Chinese pinyin modifying the terms. This convention
allows the reader to distinguish nuances that exist in the Chinese terms.

Jihua and guihua plans. The jihua plan is a more specific plan, a plan that is meant to be carried out to the letter,
whereas the guihua plan is a more general plan that is macroscopically focused. In order to retain the intended Chinese
distinction, plans will be rendered as jihua plan and guihua plan.

Bushi and bushu dispositions. Bushi disposition is the mission differentiation, organized grouping, and positioning
[deployment] accomplished for strengths within the campaign task-based organization. Bushi denotes the relationship
between one’s own military forces, the opponent’s military forces, and the combat environment (e.g., terrain). Bushu
disposition is the positioning of participating force-strengths for a fixed time and space on the basis of mission
differentiation and the organized grouping of campaign and in accordance with operational conditions and the enemy’s
possible activities.

Xitong, tixi, tizhi, and zhidu systems. The xitong system is an elemental system, one that can operate on its own. The
tixi system is similar conceptually to a System of Systems as often seen in systems engineering; in Chinese, a tixi
system is understood to be composed of elemental xitong systems acting together as a larger whole. The tizhi system is a
largescale system, typically a national-scale system and understood to be formalized embodiment of a zhidu system. The
zhidu system describes a conformance system, one where all elements of that system conform to how that system is
defined.

# $2 ^ { \mathbf { n d } }$ Edition Explanatory Notes…1

In postgraduate education, talent is fundamental and teaching materials are the foundation. In 1998, when our academy
released the First Edition Military Science Master’s Postgraduate Series Teaching Materials (55 volumes), not only was
it to play an active promoting role for strengthening the academy’s postgraduate education and improving the quality of
talent cultivation, but it was also to produce a positive effect in the domains of PLA-wide and national postgraduate
education. In December 2008, on the basis of summarizing 20 years of experience in postgraduate education, our Academy
established the objective of cultivating “high quality advanced research model talent and advanced staff officer model
talent with basic theoretical skill training and improved thinking capabilities” (also called “dual-advanced talent
{lianggao rencai},” putting forth an even higher requirement of Academy postgraduate education. In order to satisfy the
needs-requirements of “dual-advanced talent” and adapt to the new discipline catalogue promulgated by the Ministry of
Education and the curriculum setup after our Academy made its adjustments, the Academy decided to perform a revision of
the Postgraduate Series Teaching Materials ( $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ Ed.), and in 2012, it completed the work on the
$2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Edition.

The $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Edition totals 65 volumes. Amongst them, 25 are revised volumes, and 40 are new volumes
touching upon 10 first-order disciplines and 23 second-order. During the revision work, each discipline from start to
finish persisted in Marxist military theory, and especially under the guidance of Chairman Hu Jintao’s important
discourses on defense and armed forces building with the military strategic concept of the new era as the reliance and
with the pull of lively practices of recent years in in defense and armed forces modernization building, we tightly
combined the development realities of the Academy’s postgraduate education and military sciences; and while closely
centered on the goal of cultivating the “dual-advanced talents,” we paid close attention to bringing into play [end of
page 1] scientific superiority and giving expression to military characteristics and achieved an organic combination of
postgraduate education and military scientific research. First, we carried forward the outstanding achievements of the
$1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ Edition Teaching Materials. We compared and stabilized the thought, viewpoints and methods in
the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ Edition; we further refined and improved the more mature of the teaching materials in the
theoretical tixi system; and we vigorously enabled it to become the classical teaching materials in the science of
military affairs postgraduate education. Secondly, we made known the new knowledge, new achievements, new methods and
the new tixi system of the science of military affairs disciplines {junshi xue xueke}. We fully assimilated the leading
edge achievements of each discipline and we gave prominence to the innovative theoretical achievements in aspects such
as the scientific development view, armed forces informationization theory, military transformation with Chinese
characteristics and military struggle preparations, etc. We also adapted to circumstances development and gave
expression to the features of the period. Thirdly, we adhered to the teaching characteristics and laws of the discipline
specialties of the science of military affairs {junshi xue xueke zhuanye}. With the Academy Postgraduate Education
Discipline Building Guihua Plan as the basis, and both in conformity with the Academy Postgraduate Education $^ {
\mathrm { 6 6 } } 1 2 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Five-Year” Guihua Plan and in adjusting-coordination with adjustments to
the Postgraduate Curriculum Tixi System, we gave expression to knowledge structure {zhishi jiegou} requirement of the
“dual-advanced” objective. Fourthly, we correctly handled the relationship of teaching materials, lecture notes and
outlines. We placed the fairly stable and theoretically mature courses into a Teaching Material Publication Plan
{jiaocai chuban jihua}, and for some courses with contents still not quite mature but strong in farsightedness and
urgently needed, we first organized the writing of lesson outlines, and after the outlines were mature, we wrote the
lecture notes, and only after the lecture notes were mature did we write the teaching materials. Fifth, we accelerated
science building through writing of the teaching materials and improved the teaching tixi system of each discipline; we
strengthened the basic theoretical research and toughened the ranks of scientific research; we formed academic echelons
$\{ { xue shu tid u i } \}$ and spurred and aroused scientific research innovations.

The revision and publication of this set of teaching materials coalesces the large quantity of blood and sweat of the
leadership, experts, advisors and associated workers at each level. Academy Superintendent Liu Chengjun {刘成军} personally
assumed the position of Chairman of the Academy Teaching Material Editorial Review Committee. Political Commissar Sun
Sijing {孙思敬} was extremely concerned with the teaching materials revision work and putting forth the requirement for
writing and publishing a high quality postgraduate education teaching material that reflects the features of the period
and military characteristics. Deputy Superintendents Liu Jixian {刘继贤} and Xu Lili {徐莉 莉} assumed the positions of
Vice-Chairmen of the Editorial Review Committee and personally organized the revision work. Experts and advisors
participating in writing the teaching materials committed themselves to the work with an abundance of enthusiasm [end of
page 2] and a high level of responsibility as they extensively investigated, researched, and worked extra hours to
complete the writing task on schedule. The Scientific Research Guidance Dept. on multiple occasions organized the
solicitation of ideas from research departments, institutes and advisors, and carefully studied the teaching material
revision proposal; they promptly grasped the writing progress, earnestly coordinated the finalization of the
publication, and accomplished a great amount of arduous and detailed work. The Military Science Press treated the
publication of the teaching materials as a major task as they meticulously organized, designed edited, and proofread to
ensure the quality of publication.

Due to the limits of writing time and levels, the tixi system of the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } } .$ Edition teaching
materials is insufficiently complete, and some content is still inadequate; we solicit all concerned experts and the
broad mass of postgraduate students to put forth revision ideas in order to facilitate further improvements.

# Lecture 1 Introduction...1

History makes it clear to us that at the same time that the footprints of mankind’s activities enter a brand-new space,
[mankind] often carries genes for games of confrontation, and in the process of [mankind’s] development forward, [these
genes] are constantly interpreted as an intense military competition.

In the latter half of the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } } \ .$ century, the rapid development of space technology led mankind
to enter into a completely new Space Age, and struggles centered on the initiative in space have followed along with
this. Early on, in the beginning of the 1960s, US President [John F.] Kennedy clearly pointed out that “A struggle for
dominance in space will be the main detail in the coming ten years. Whichever country can control space, can control the
world.” For several decades after this, the major powers of the world launched the study and exploration of such major
issues as the exploitation and use of space resources, military space technology, military theory of space, and the use
of space operations, [all] centered on the strategic core that is “space.” As the pace of the militarization of space
has continually accelerated, competition has become increasingly intense, and the curtain of space confrontations has
been drawn open. The several local wars that have recently occurred before our eyes have shown that whoever is strong in
military spaceflight will rule the battlefield, that he in whose hands lies space superiority will master the initiative
in warfare, and that with the support of “space,” it is possible to win victory, but without the support of “space,”
this is impossible.

A great many details, such as space operations strengths, space weapons and equipment, the command of space operations,
and space information systems, are incrementally being interpreted as basic key factors that are indispensable in
informationized warfare. At the same time, they are becoming important basic supports for operations under
informationized conditions. Although the peaceful use of space has become an international consensus, steps centered on
the struggle for space military superiority have never stopped. The world’s military powers and space powers, headed by
the United States, have listed space operations as a main sphere of study for future warfare, and have used this to pull
along the rapid buildup and innovative development of operational strengths, weapons and equipment, forms of operations,
and theories of operations. Space operations have developed up until now, and they no longer are a “new fairy tale”
being quietly performed on the stage of warfare, but rather have become a “normal drama” that is frequently performed in
modern warfare. Space operations have strode to the foreground, and they permeate the entire process of operations; they
are now developing from a single form of space information support to complex operations in space

confrontations, and are continually penetrating each important link of operations, playing a decisive role in victory or
defeat in warfare.

The importance of space operations for modern warfare has taken the lead in the study of military theory. Innovations in
the study of space military theory and promoting practices in space operations are the subject of this course. This
lecture primarily explores issues in such aspects as the basic concepts of space operations and the science of space
operations, categories of study, methods of study, principles of study, the development process of space operations, and
their impact on modern warfare, and it aims at clearly outlining the basic outline of the science of space operations
and at clarifying the logical starting point in the science of space operations, and starting with recognizing and
understanding the basic connotations of space operations and the science of space operations, it will gradually develop
in-depth into a fairly comprehensive systematic study, and will carry out a general explanation of space operations and
the science of space operations.

# Section 1: An Outline of Space Operations...2

In studying the science of space operations, it is first necessary to clarify the basic connotations of space
operations, their formation and development, and their role in modern warfare.

# I. The definition of space operations...2

Clausewitz made this statement in his On War: “Any theory must first clarify disorderly, or one could say confused,
notions and concepts. Only by having a common understanding of terms and concepts is it possible to clearly and smoothly
study issues, and possible to stand together with the reader on the same standpoint. If we do not accurately determine
the concepts [of a theory], we will then be unable to thoroughly understand its innate laws and interrelationships.”1
Therefore, in studying the science of space operations, it is necessary to first clarify the concepts of space
operations, and to use this in order to unify our understanding and prompt a more in-depth study of space operations.

In clarifying the concepts of space operations, it is first necessary to clarify [the concept of] space and its
interrelated concepts. Usually, “the sailing activities of manned and unmanned spacecraft beyond the earth’s atmosphere”
are called spaceflight. It can be seen that the “space” in spaceflight refers to cosmic space beyond the earth’s
atmosphere. Space within the earth’s atmosphere is called “air;” aircraft can only fly within the atmosphere, so this is
called aeronautics. Early on, when the International Aeronautical Federation held a meeting in Barcelona in the 1960s,
it specified that an altitude of 100 kilometers would be the upper boundary of the atmosphere, and this was widely
accepted as the boundary of spaceflight and boundary of aeronautics. Therefore, people refer to the broad cosmic spaces
beyond the atmosphere at more than 100 kilometers above the earth’s sea level as “space,” and it is also commonly called
“outer space.” They differentiate it into three types: 100 kilometers to 40,000 kilometers above the earth’s surface is
called near-earth space, 40,000 kilometers to 384,000 kilometers is called farearth space, and more than 384,000
kilometers is called interplanetary space. Currently, human use of space, and particularly military use, is still
primarily in near-earth space.

In recent years, the concept of near space is often seen in academic journals and various media. Near space is also
called near outer-space or the air-space transitional zone, and it usually refers to the airspace between the highest
altitude at which existing aircraft fly (about twenty kilometers) and the lowest altitude (about 100 kilometers) at
which satellites move in orbit; it primarily includes most of the atmosphere’s stratosphere region, all of the
atmosphere’s mesosphere region, and part of its thermosphere region (see Figure 1-1).

Figure 1-1: The Relations between the Various Near-space and Atmospheric Layers

The concept of space operations first appeared in the AFM1-1 doctrine published by the US Air Force in 1971. This
doctrine considered that “Space operations refer to a series of operational actions that include space command, force
enhancement, and space support.”

Following this, the various countries of the world have launched wide-ranging studies into the issue of space
operations, and explained space operations from differing angles.

The US military for the most part defines the concept of space operations from the angle of operational missions. The
Space Operations doctrine that the US Air Force issued in August 1998 and the Joint Doctrine: Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Space Operations (draft) drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in January 2000 define space operations as
“a series of operational actions or military activities, including space combat (including space control and force
applications), combat support (primarily referring to force enhancement), and space support (including spacecraft
launches and protection in orbit).” Official documents from the US Department of Defense define four categories of
operations in space operations. The first is offensive anti-space operations, that is, actively attacking the enemy by
weakening, damaging, or destroying the enemy’s space strengths. Offensive anti-space operations use two means, soft kill
and hard kill, to achieve the five goals of deception, interruption, denial, deprivation, and destruction. The second is
defensive anti-space operations, that is, adopting forms of active defense and passive defense to ensure that US space
strengths avoid enemy attack or jamming. In this, active defense refers to detecting, tracking, identifying, and
intercepting enemy space strengths and ballistic missiles; passive defense refers to the use of such measures as
camouflage, concealment, deception, mobility, and dispersal to ensure the security of space strengths. The third is
operations to attack the earth, that is, the use of spaceflight equipment to attack the enemy’s important airborne or
surface targets. The fourth is force enhancement operations, that is, operational actions whose goal is the use of space
reconnaissance and surveillance, missile early warning, navigation and positioning, and space communications systems to
reinforce land, sea, and air operational strengths.

The Soviet military believed that space operations were the sum total of operational actions that used space weapons and
space military systems to resist enemy space weapons and space military systems, under the leadership of the state’s
supreme military command organ, with the goals of weakening the enemy’s space strengths and seizing command of space.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, the Russian military continued to treat space strengths as crucial factors for
determining its status as a great power, and it never interrupted its studies of space operations theory. Based on the
Operations and Applications of Spacecraft that Russia published in 1995 and on Russian Military Doctrine (draft) and
Methods of Space Activities, Russia’s military defines space operations as a series of military actions that use space
strengths to support their own side’s armed units in smoothly carrying out their operational mission, and that engage in
offensive and defensive confrontations in space with the enemy. The missions of space operations primarily consist of
fourteen basic tasks: attacks (against ground targets), interception (against spacecraft), reconnaissance,
communications, electronic warfare, early warning, geodesy, weather, search and rescue, control, detection of nuclear
explosions, navigation, radiation forecasts, and transportation. Space strengths not only can independently carry out
their operational missions, but they can also participate in joint operations, closely cooperating with other services,
in order to jointly complete operational missions.

The Chinese Military Encyclopedia – Volume on War and Strategy that the PRC military published in 1993 considers that
“Space warfare is military confrontations carried out by hostile nations in outer space. It is also called space warfare
or outer space warfare. It includes military offensive and defensive actions in outer space, actions from outer space to
attack airborne or ground targets, as well as actions carried out from the ground or the air with the goal of damaging
space systems or rendering them ineffective.”2 The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Military Terminology, published in
1997, considers that “Outer space warfare, also called space warfare, is military confrontational activities that two
hostile sides primarily carry out in outer space. It includes offensive and defensive actions against each other in
outer space as well as offensive and defensive actions against each other that are carried out between outer space and
the air or ground.”3 The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Military Terminology (complete version), published in 2011,
believes that “Outer space warfare is also called space warfare. It is confrontational activities that are carried out
in outer space, primarily using military spaceflight strengths. It includes offensive and defensive actions in outer
space as well as offensive and defensive actions that are carried out between outer space and the air, ground, or sea.”4

To summarize the above, space operations are military confrontational activities that two hostile sides engage in
primarily in space. Their essence is that they are a series of operational actions where two hostile sides use their
space strengths as their main operational strengths and space as their main battlefield in order to seize, hold, and use
command of space. They directly serve a certain part of the war or even the entire war situation, and they play an
irreplaceable and unique role in gaining victory in warfare. For example, the use of reconnaissance satellites can track
and monitor the enemy’s military activities, in real-time and continuously, so that joint units’ commanders continuously
stay abreast of how the enemy’s troop strengths are deployed, how his firepower is deployed, and how his positions are
deployed, so that [the commanders] adopt corresponding measures in a focused manner. [Another example is that] by using

communications satellites, it is possible to achieve global and continuous communications in all weathers, that are
strongly encrypted and highly reliable, so that the commanders can exercise flexible and effective command and control
over their subordinate units. [A final example is that] navigation satellites not only can ensure that units at each
echelon move rapidly and accurately, but they can also ensure that the various types of precision-guided munitions
overcome the impact of unfavorable factors like climate and weather, in order to carry out long-distance precision
attacks against the enemy.

In coming to an understanding of these definitions, we should have a grasp on the following several points.

First is to have space strengths be the main body in operations. Space strengths are the physical basis for organizing
and carrying out space operations. Based on their missions, they can be divided into space information support
strengths, space offensive and defensive strengths, space service and support strengths, and space operations command
strengths. Space information support strengths refer to strengths that provide information support such as
reconnaissance and surveillance, missile early warning, communications relay, navigation and positioning, meteorological
observation, and battlefield mapping, from space, for land, sea, air, and space operational strengths. Space offensive
and defensive strengths include space attack strengths and space defense strengths. Of these, space offensive strengths
refer to strengths that carry out space attacks against important enemy space, air, naval, and land military targets,
while space defensive strengths refer to strengths that block the space reconnaissance and attacks carried out by the
enemy against your own side and that ensure your own side’s space security. Space service and support strengths refer to
strengths that provide space transportation, operations materiel supplies, base engineering support, and technical
maintenance of equipment in order to ensure that control of space and use of space are carried out smoothly. Space
operations command strengths refer to command and control strengths that ensure that the various space operations
actions are smoothly carried out. The US military believes that the integration of space operations strengths with air,
land, sea, and special operations units means stronger operational capabilities of various kinds. By fully bringing into
play the roles of space operations strengths, it is not only possible to greatly strengthen the operational capabilities
of joint units and to speed up the reactions of joint units, but at the same time it is also possible to greatly improve
the defense capabilities of joint units, thus ensuring gaining maximum combat results at a maximum speed and minimal
cost. Without effective assistance and support from space strengths, it will be difficult for the various services and
service arms to smoothly launch and carry out various types of operational actions.

Second is to have space as the main battlefield. The battlefields of space operations include space, the air, the sea,
and the land, but space is the main battlefield, and the main operations platforms are spacecraft. Spacecraft not only
are platforms equipped with various types of lethal weapons and information devices, and transportation tools with
various types of operational materials and personnel, for both sides in operations, but at the same time they are also
targets whereby the two hostile sides attack each other. Regardless of what kinds of space operations actions are
carried out, their operational activities mainly center on ensuring that spacecraft smoothly provide information
support, that they transport personnel and materials, that they attack important enemy air, sea, and land targets, and
that they are done to destroy enemy spacecraft that are performing these tasks; these operational activities are
primarily performed in space. Although the land, sea, and air battlefields are also important battlefields for space
operations, they only are bases for launching and recovering spacecraft and sites for reconnaissance and attacks against
space.

Third is to have seizing, holding, and using command of space as the mission of their operations. The mission in future
space operations will be mainly reflected in two areas. On the one hand, they will seize and hold command of space, that
is, at the same time that they ensure that their own side’s space strengths fully bring their effectiveness into play,
they will limit, weaken, and destroy the enemy’s space strengths. This will not only include carrying out offensive and
defensive actions in space against the enemy’s space strengths, but they will also include offensive actions carried out
against the various kinds of installations of the enemy’s space strengths, situated on the land, at sea, and in the air,
by using such means as long-range firepower attacks, information warfare, and in-depth assaults by special units of the
land, sea, and air operational strengths, as well as defensive actions that are adopted against such attacks by the
enemy. On the other hand, they will use command of space, that is, they will use space strengths not only to provide
reconnaissance and surveillance, missile early warning, and communications relay, and such battlefield information
support for their own side’s land, sea, and air operational strengths as navigation and positioning, weather
observations, and battlefield mapping, but they will also engage in firepower attacks against important enemy targets in
the air, at sea, and on land.

# II. The developmental process of space operations...7

With the emergence of space technology and equipment and their application in war practices, the practice and theory of
space operations began to appear and has continually developed; in general, it has undergone a seminal stage, a
formative stage, and a developmental stage.

1. Seminal stage

From the mid- and late 1950s to the early 1980s was the seminal stage in the development of space operations. This stage
was precisely the Cold War period of intense US-Soviet confrontation, and the development of space strengths was deeply
branded by the “Cold War.” The space strengths of the United States and the Soviet Union primarily served each
[country’s] nuclear deterrence strategies. First, they provided early warning for strategic nuclear defense, and [the
countries] conceived of intercepting enemy ballistic missiles from space. For example, the United States in 1983
proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (commonly called the Star Wars program), and it intended to establish a
defensive shield in space, following several decades of efforts (this initiative later never materialized, for
political, economic, and scientific and technological reasons). Second, [the space strengths] provided reconnaissance,
navigational, communications, and weather information support for strategic nuclear attacks, ensuring the accuracy and
effectiveness of strategic nuclear attacks. Third, they provided surveillance and detection means for international
nuclear weapons inspections and effectively controlled nuclear proliferation, thus maintaining world-wide nuclear
stability. It can be seen that space strengths in reality became an extension of nuclear deterrence strengths. At the
same time, space strengths were also used in various major political crises and local wars, like the Berlin Crisis, the
Cuban missile crisis, the Fourth Middle East War, and the British-Argentine Malvinas Islands War. Because of the
restrictions of historical conditions, space strengths were primarily used at the strategic level, in order to serve the
major powers’ nuclear deterrence strategies, and to a certain extent partially met the needs of conventional wars for
battlefield information; they reinforced the operational effectiveness of combat units, and thus the prototype of space
operations made its initial appearance.

During this stage, the theory of space operations saw its initial generation. As various types of military satellite
systems rapidly appeared and were applied to the military sphere, the various nations’ research and development of
anti-satellite weapons also became something that space powers like the United States and the Soviet Union became
passionate about, and the idea of confrontational activities in space began to appear. In 1958, the US Department of
Defense set about research on such issues as turning nearearth outer space into a possible battlefield and determining
forms of weapons and technological weapons systems, the characteristics of combat actions that would be carried out in
near-earth outer space, the ways of seizing command of space in near-earth outer space, and the impact that this would
have on carrying out armed conflict. The United States Air Force Basic Doctrine, in 1959, for the first time used the
term “aerospace,” and replaced the word “air;” at the same time, it defined the Air Force’s battlefield as the “entire
space above the earth’s surface,” that is, “aerospace” space. A

1962 book, Military Strategy, [Soviet Doctrine and Concepts], whose chief editor was Marshal of the Soviet Union [Vasily
D.] Sokolovsky, believed that the scope of space for future wars was huge, the cosmos would become the battlefield, and
military actions could engulf the cosmos. As the types and scales of military satellites rapidly expanded, their
technical functions that could serve warfare were a focus of development. The United States and the Soviet Union formed
relative complete systems of military space equipment that included reconnaissance satellites, communications
satellites, navigational satellites, weather satellites, and geodetic satellites, and carried out a number of
anti-satellite tests, so that they preliminarily had the ability for anti-satellite operations. With the birth of
practices in space operations, theories of space operations initially emerged. The 1971 US Air Force Operational
Doctrine5 for the first time specified the tasks of the Air Force in outer space, clearly indicating that the US Air
Force had the responsibility for military activities related to spacecraft and for “ensuring that other nations cannot
use space to explore and seize interests strategically.” This marked the birth of the US Air Force’s theory of space
operations. The 1979 edition of this doctrine further clarified the Air Force’s space missions as: spaceflight support,
combat power enhancement, and outer space defense. The Soviet Military Encyclopedia that was published in the late 1970s
pointed out that “In order to resist assaults that the enemy carries out from aerospace, various types of weapons should
be used to carry out campaigns of a strategic nature to resist aerospace assaults.” Given the restrictions of space
military technical equipment levels, the theory of space operations had yet to be merged with overall theories of
operations and was still in the seminal stage, without achieving organic “interface” with the operational theories,
operational systems, and operational equipment of that time.

2. Formative stage

From the early 1980s to the late 1990s was the formative stage of space operations’ development. During this stage, not
only did space operations strengths achieve fairly great developments in their types and scale, but the technical and
tactical performance of space operations equipment was also enhanced to a fairly great degree, they had fairly strong
battlefield information assistance and support capabilities, and they came into fairly large-scale use in the several
local wars. In particular, during the 1991 Gulf War, the multinational forces headed by the United States mobilized more
than seventy satellites to carry out information assistance and support in many areas, such as space reconnaissance and
surveillance, missile early warning, navigation and positioning, communications relay, and weather observations, and
this made huge contributions to the multinational forces’ victory. The Gulf War was called the “first space war,”
showing the vast magic and fascination of space operations, but it also revealed a series of problems as space
operations expanded from an emphasis on serving nations’ nuclear strategy to serving modern local wars. These problems
primarily included: first, the process of deployment of space operations strengths as they reacted to emergencies took
too long; second, systems compatibility was not strong; third, the technical and tactical norms of spaceflight equipment
were not high, and it was difficult for them to adapt to battlefield environments that changed in the twinkling of an
eye; and fourth, the command system of space operations was rigid, its information flow was not rational, and command
and combat personnel at the various echelons lacked sufficient understanding of space operations strengths, so that they
had no way to effectively use these in operations. After the Gulf War, the US military summarized its experiences and
lessons involving space operations, and further strengthened its buildup of space strengths. In the 1999 Kosovo
Campaign, the space operations strengths of the NATO units, in which the US military predominated, were greatly expanded
over the Gulf War, both in support to operational actions and in their scale and quality. A former commander of the US
military’s Space Command, General [Richard] Myers, pointed out that “The Kosovo Campaign was indeed a war that was
launched from space. In the Kosovo Campaign, our space information support reached completely new heights. As everyone
knows, in Operation Desert Storm, many people complained that space support did not reach the campaign and tactical
levels, but this operation of ours saw great progress in this area.”

In this stage, the theory of space operations took shape incrementally. The “joint spaceland operations” and “greatly
in-depth three dimensional operations” theories that the United States and the Soviet Union put forward, in turn,
advocated the need to aim at the new characteristics of modern warfare, to be “global, fully in-depth, full-spectrum,
and highly three-dimensional” as they prepared for war, and to pay more attention in their operations to the support
role of outer space information systems for the battlefield. Against this background, the space commands of the three US
services and the Joint Space Command were established, one after the other. The US Air Force Space Command formally
published the first work on space operations in October 1982, Military Space Doctrine, which marked the initial
formation of the US military’s space operations theory. Space Operations, which was completed in 1990 [sic], provided a
complete systematic exposition on space operations theory, and the US military’s theory on space operations was formally
established by this. The mission of the US Air Force was further clarified as control of space, use of strengths,
reinforcement of strengths, and spaceflight support, and spaceflight operations gradually began to stress the deployment
of space strengths; there was an emphasis on using the space environment to reinforce ground strengths. Since 1992, the
US military has published a series of doctrinal documents on space operations, such as The Basic Aerospace Doctrine of
the United

States Air Force, Military Space Doctrine, the United States’ Air Force Doctrine Document 2-2, Space Operations, and the
United States’ Air Force Counterspace Operations Doctrine, proposed the concept of “space campaigns,” clarifying the
command and control and the guiding principles of defensive space confrontational actions and offensive space
confrontational actions, as well as the requirements and procedures for carrying out joint space campaigns. The Soviet
military’s senior-level generals, based on how space-based reconnaissance, surveillance, navigation, and early warning
systems were developing, proposed the “information warfare” concept and theory, with a focus on space operations. In
June 1995, Russia published the Applications in Operations of Spacecraft, which fully discussed basic theoretical and
actual operating issues for how the armed forces, and particularly the air force, were to use spacecraft and resist
enemy spacecraft, when drafting plans of operations and when carrying out operational missions. At the same time, they
focused on analyzing the United States’ space strengths and pointed out the basic methods for confronting them. Space
operations theory moved from the strategic command level to the tactical operating level, gradually forming a system of
space operations theory that was commensurate with space operations strengths.

# 3. Developmental stage

From the late 1990s until now is the stage where space operations have rapidly developed. The several modern local wars
of the 1990s highlighted the status and role of space operations, setting off an upsurge among the various countries of
the world, and especially military powers, to develop space operation strengths. Some countries introduced plans for the
military development of space, one after another, and sped up the pace in the construction of space operations
strengths, while the theory of space operations also entered overall into a preparatory stage for actual warfare
applications. In April 1998, the US military’s Joint Space Command released a Long-Range Plan – Vision for 2020 [sic],
in which it proposed four major concepts in space operations: control of space, global engagement, full-force
integration, and global partnership. This theory especially emphasized that integrated space strengths should be fully
utilized, that ballistic missile defense [should] be carried out using space as a base, and that various types of
spacecraft, ballistic missiles, aircraft, ships, and land high-value targets [should] be attacked from space. In order
to meet the needs of future space operations, the United States combined a space operations command center [sic] and a
bureau of space command and control [sic] into a space command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance center at the end of 1999, directly led by Space Command. At the same time, the United States withdrew in
2001 from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that the United States and the Soviet Union had signed in 1972, in order to
clear away obstacles for the National Missile Defense System and space operations, and it formally deployed a missile
defense system and comprehensively started a space warfare plan. In order to enhance its abilities for actual warfare in
space operations, the US military organized and launched a Schriever system of war games, every two years, and from 22
to 26 January 2001 held the first Schriever I simulated war game in space operations. Up until this year, it has
organized seven Schriever war games. The seventh Schriever war game, which the US military held from 19 to 26 April
2012, differed very much from previous war games, and was called the Schriever-2012 International war game (SW-2012
International). This war game focused on carrying out drills on “how to use outer space and network strengths in future
conflicts” and it examined the US Air Force Space Command’s operations command system and spaceflight systems, as well
as coordination between spaceflight and ground systems; it was an important means by which the US military strengthened
its space-network deterrence capabilities. This war game incorporated NATO and Australia, and it used even more space
resources, in order to improve the ability of the US military’s and its allies’ outer space and network spaces
operations; this resulted in the US military’s space operations again making a great stride forward. Russia treats space
superiority as an important foundation for ensuring national security; in order to ensure that it gets space superiority
in future wars, at the same time that the Russian military has vigorously developed space offensive weapons and improved
its theory of space operations, it also formally organized its Space Forces on 1 June 2001, on the basis of its former
Strategic Rocket Forces space units and anti-missile space units, directly subordinate to the Russian military’s General
Staff. Russian President [Vladimir] Putin has also promised that, given the situation where the United States insists on
having a missile defense system, “No matter how impoverished Russia is, it cannot impoverish its space operations
units;” national defense expenditures will focus in the future on spaceflight enterprises, in order to ensure that
“space operations units get rational and sufficient funding support.”

In this stage, space operations theory continually developed and improved, which was primarily reflected in the
developmental aspects of the US military’s and Russian military’s space operations theories. The US Air Force published
its AFDD 2-2 Space Operations doctrine in 1998, and it revised this and reissued it in 2001, 2004, and 2006; of these,
the 2004 revised edition had its name changed to Counterspace Operations. These doctrines stipulated in fairly great
detail the forms by which the US Air Force would carry out command and control and deployment and execution in space
operations. In August 2002, the US military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff issued its Joint Space Operations Doctrine [sic]
(JP3-14), and in January 2009 it issued a revised version, Space Operations Joint Doctrine [sic] (JP3-14). These
doctrines were aimed at providing guidance plans for planning and carrying out joint space operations, and to provide a
basic foundation for space operations by all operational personnel, in the air, on land, at sea, in space, and in
special forces, as well as basic principles for space operations, in

order to establish a guiding framework for the use of space strengths and space capabilities. The Russian military’s
theory of space operations also made breakthroughs. In 2001, Russia proposed a comprehensively improved theory of space
operations in its National Space Plan Prior to 2010, and it systemically defined the principles of space operations, the
division of areas of operations, the targets of operations, operations weapons systems, and main forms of operations. It
envisaged three operational forms for dealing with future space operations: space offensive operations, space defensive
operations, and space support operations. It divided space operations weapons systems into two major parts: space
offensive and defensive operations weapons systems and space support operations weapons systems. [Finally,] it revisited
a series of research concepts, such as land-based high-powered anti-satellite laser weapons, orbital bombers, manned
space battle stations, and spaceplanes.

The competitive developments by the two space military powers – the United States and Russia – in the areas of space
operations strengths and space operations theory also promoted developments by some other countries and regions in the
buildup of space operations strengths and in the development of space operations theory.

# III. The impact of space operations on modern warfare...12

Historically, every time a new space has become an important battlefield for military confrontations, this has had an
intense impact on the state of warfare and on world military developments. The naval operations of the $1 9 ^ { \mathrm
{ t h } }$ century and the air operations of the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century dominated warfare, one after the
other, and greatly changed the military face of the world. The space operations of the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$
century have already skyrocketed, and have generated a decisive and basic impact on modern warfare and on the world’s
military development.

1. They have changed people’s concepts of time and space in warfare

The emergence of space operations again extended the footprint of warfare, and brought about new changes in the concepts
of time and space in warfare; warfare extended beyond the atmosphere and was carried out in multi-dimensional spaces. In
the Gulf War, the command post of the multinational force was set up in the front lines of the Gulf, but by Operation
Desert Fox and the Kosovo Campaign, the US military’s command post, relying upon space command and communications
systems, was changed to the US homeland, and the distance between the command organization and the battlefield reached
more than 10,000 kilometers. Operational platforms were also like this; cruise missiles launched from submarines and
aircraft, by relying upon space positioning systems, could attack targets more than 1,000 kilometers away. As space
military

information systems developed and improved, the scope of the battlefield expanded further, and the boundaries between
forward and rear areas gradually disappeared; the age of the “global battlefield" incrementally became reality. Space
operations also sped up the rhythm of warfare to an unprecedented extent; prior to the emergence of the space operations
form, the speed at which operational platforms moved did not exceed several dozen meters to several hundred meters per
second, and the speed of munitions’ flight also did not exceed several hundred meters to several kilometers per second.
In space operations, operational strengths’ movement and the speed of firing also were greatly increased; the speed of
spacecraft’s flight could reach several kilometers per second, and the speed of attack by directed energy weapons and
laser weapons could reach 300,000 kilometers a second, several dozen times and up to ten thousand times the speed of
movement and of firing in the air, respectively. They could launch instantaneous attacks against global targets.
Surprise in warfare increased to an unprecedented extent, the time period for early warning was reduced, battlefield
situations changed in the twinkling of an eye, and “blitzkrieg warfare” could truly be conducted at the speed of
lightning; warfare at the level of hours, at the level of minutes, and even at the level of seconds was an emerging
trend. The emergence of space operations has constantly sped up the rhythm of warfare, and the interrelationship between
time and space has undergone major changes. Time in warfare has increased in value, while the size of national territory
and how deep or shallow depths are basically are no longer an important limiting factor in the age of space operations,
and it is difficult to achieve goals by exchanging space for time, while using time to struggle for space will become
the new strategic choice.

2. They have given new connotations to initiative in warfare

As the state of war has evolved, the focus of the initiative in warfare has been transformed from dominating the land to
command of the sea, and then to command of the air; it now has switched toward command of space, which is daily
manifesting its huge value in dominating victory or defeat in war. Space has already replaced the air as the new high
ground of war; whoever seizes command of space will be able to look down on and control the other battlefields from on
high, and will be able to use space information systems in an effective manner to ensure that weapons systems on land,
at sea, and in the air are able to operate in a stable manner; if it is the opposite, then without command of space or
local command of space, it will be very difficult to seize and hold command of the air and command of the sea,; you
probably will be put on the defensive in war, and it will be difficult for your space information systems to operate
effectively, and it will be even less use to talk about support to weapons systems on land, at sea, and in the air. The
basic goal in seizing command of the air is to damage the enemy’s space systems and to limit the enemy’s freedom to act
in space, while protecting your own side’s space systems and ensuring your own side’s freedom to act in space. The
fragility of space systems and the ease with which they are destroyed, as well as the complexity of space defensive
technology, makes it quite possible that space attacks will become a primary means for seizing command of space,
becoming an important detail in seizing the initiative in warfare.

3. They have sped up the integration of air and space defense

The emergence of space operations has brought about new changes in the threat of warfare, and attacks carried out from
space have increasingly become a new form of warfare; merged with air attacks, they have become a primary threat in
informationized warfare and have thus sped up the pace of integrated air-space defense. Air-space defense is
characterized by its breadth and complexity; strategic reconnaissance and strategic air raids not only come from the air
but also from space, requiring the establishment of an integrated air defense and space defense command organization and
the implementation of integrated command, so that air defense and space defense operations cooperate with each other,
support each other, and are closely coordinated, thus carrying out integrated confrontations. Air-space defense has the
characteristics of [covering] all directions, having multiple levels, having great depth, and diversity, and there is no
way to achieve the goals of defense against strategic air raids by relying upon a single strength. Therefore,
establishing an integrated system of strengths in which space strengths (or space forces) and the air force predominate
and in which relevant ground forces, navy, and civil air defense strengths jointly participate has become an important
objective in the current world military buildup. The characteristics of air and space raid weapons, with their diverse
forms of attack, their lethality and damage effects that differ from each other, their great suddenness, and their
strong ability to penetrate defenses, require that space defense weapons be integrated militarily with air defense
weapons on the land, at sea, and in the air; that means of active defense and means of passive defense be integrated;
that means of hard kill and means of soft kill be integrated; and that resistance, counterattack, and defense systems be
integrated. Not only does this fully bring into play the roles of the various means of operations, but it also keeps
them from throwing each other out of balance and resulting in losses from internal strife, thus forming overall effects
of operations where “one plus one is greater than two.”

4. They give birth to a new focus of attack in warfare [Major General John F.C.] Fuller pointed out that “The combat
power of a military exists in its organization. Killing the enemy is a war of the body; making its command authority
ineffective is a war of the mind.” The rapid development of information technology and its widespread use in the
military sphere have brought mankind truly into the age of the “war of the mind.” Killing using swords and spears and
destruction using firearms

became the main forms for achieving the goals of warfare in the age of the “war of the body.” In the age of the “war of
the mind,” attacking the enemy’s command and control systems and his psychological knowledge has become the main form
for achieving the goals of warfare, which has greatly replaced the previous bloody forms of warfare. Changes in the form
of warfare have brought about a transformation in the focus of attack. Command and control systems have become crucial
targets of attack, while space information systems have become the most crucial thing in the age of “warfare of the
mind,” directly determining whether or not command and control systems operate effectively. Thus, destruction of the
opponent’s space-based systems and damage to his command and control systems have become the new focus of attack in
warfare.

# Section 2: Outline of the Science of Space Operations...14

With the rapid development of the practices of space operations, knowledge and understanding of space operations has
continually deepened, the results of studies into space operations have daily become richer, and knowledge of the theory
of space operations has incrementally formed systems and given birth to a new discipline: the science of space
operations.

The science of space operations is a discipline that studies the laws and laws for guiding space operations, and that is
used to guide preparations for and execution of space operations; it is a systematized rational knowledge of the
formation of space operations, on the basis of a refinement of the practices and theories of space operations that have
been constantly accumulated, and on [the basis of] the broad-ranging absorption and scientific integration of the
theories of space operations. Currently, the science of space operations basically has all the main conditions that a
comprehensive and independent discipline should have: the target of study is explicit, the structure of knowledge is
systematic, the context of its formation and development is clear, and it has a set of scientific methods and means that
are needed for obtaining the knowledge and materials for this discipline. The science of space operations primarily
includes foundational theoretical knowledge for space operations, such as its basic concepts, basic laws, basic
principles, and basic rules. It is a theoretical result that is basic, long-lasting, systematic, and relatively stable,
and it plays the role of basic theoretical guidance for the laws, courses of study, and teaching materials of space
operations. The laws, courses of study, and teaching materials for space operations, with the science of space
operations as the guide for basic theory, have launched and refined any given aspect and any given level of the science
of space operations; its relevance, applicability, and operability are relatively strong, and there are specific,
realistic, near-term, and local theoretical results.

# I. The objects, tasks, and contents of study in the science of space operations...15

An in-depth study of the science of space operations requires being clear about the targets of study, the tasks being
studied, the details being studied, and the system of theories of the science of space operations.

1. The objects of study in the science of space operations

An important symbol and basic foundation for whether or not a given discipline can exist independently is whether it has
targets of study or not. As an independent discipline, the targets of study in the science of space operations are space
operations.

Space operations are the objects that the science of space operations studies, and they consist of two parts: space
operations that have already occurred and space operations that could occur in the future. The science of space
operations is a practical science, originating in practices and guiding practices. Investigating and studying battle
examples of space operations that have already occurred are quite important for revealing the laws of space operations,
for predicting developmental trends in space operations, and for guiding future space operations. The history of human
warfare shows that it is on the basis of summarizing their experiences in past wars that people generally propose new
theories of warfare to guide the practices of warfare, and it is through theories of warfare that have been revised and
developed through war practices that they guide their preparations for the next war. If it is separated from the
experiences of wars that have occurred in the past, the science of space operations becomes water without a source and a
tree without roots. However, the science of space operations also cannot merely remain a summary of the experiences in
space operations that have already occurred; what is more important is that even before the next space operations occur,
that it scientifically predict future space operations and their developmental trends, and that it draft corresponding
countermeasures. Therefore, space operations that could occur in the future are also an important detail in studying the
science of space operations.

The science of space operations should conceive of, study, and resolve new situations and new issues that future space
operations could encounter, based on developments in the equipment and technology of space operations, adjustments to
[these operations’] organizational system and organizational structure, changes to the many factors of the future space
battlefield, and innovations in operational concepts. Because space operations are a brutal confrontation between two
hostile sides, it is impossible to carry out tests of future operations using real guns and live bullets. Therefore, all
that we can do in peacetime is to simulate practices in space operations that could occur in the future, using training
and exercises; it is also possible to learn from the experiences of foreign

militaries, in order to stimulate our thinking, broaden our innovation, and thus take the initiative in responding to
changes.

2. The tasks that the science of space operations studies

The tasks that the science of space operations studies generally mainly include revealing the laws and laws for guiding
space operations, and predicting developmental trends in space operations.

First is revealing the laws of space operations. As an important component part and an objective phenomenon of human
society’s military activities, space operations have innate laws. The laws of space operations include laws that are
generated and develop on their own and the laws of space operations actions. These laws are objective and inevitable;
they do not rely upon human will to exist and transform, but they can be understood, mastered, and used by people. If
people want to correctly understand and control space operations and guide them toward victory, then they have no choice
but to study and abide by the laws of space operations. Just at Mao Zedong said, the laws of war are an issue that
people guiding any war must study and must resolve. The laws of space operations are important issues that those people
guiding warfare in the Information Age must have deep insight into; only by mastering the laws of space operations is it
possible to gain freedom of action in the practices of space operations. Otherwise, you must suffer setbacks, leading to
defeat. Therefore, the study of space operations treats revealing the laws of space operations as a primary task to be
studied.

Second is to predict developmental trends in space operations. Space operations are a dynamically developing objective
thing; the past, the present, and the future will not have two entirely identical space operations appear. The goal in
studying space operations is to guide the practices of future space operations. Therefore, predicting developmental
trends in space operations has become an important task in the science of space operations; it primarily explains the
laws of development and change in space operations and makes a scientific judgment about developmental trends in future
space operations, on the basis of analyzing and studying movement in the various inner key factors in space operations
and the impact of exterior factors. Only in this way is it possible to be prepared in advance before future space
operations occur and to seize the initiative and win victory when space operations occur.

Third is to explore the laws for guiding space operations. The laws for guiding space operations are innate laws within
the process where the person guiding space operations commands the space operations. Speaking from an epistemological
angle, they are laws where the person guiding space operations abides by objective laws of space operations and by
which, on the basis of objective physical conditions, he dynamically resolves various contradictions and issues that
appear during the process of space operations, in order to seize victory in space operations. They are specifically
manifested as the principles and tenets for guiding space operations that correspond to the objective laws of space
operations. Mao Zedong vividly referred to the laws for guiding war as the “art of swimming in the sea.” Therefore, the
science of space operations treats revealing the laws for guiding space operations as an important task to be studied.
The objective laws of space operations determine the laws for guiding space operations, and the laws for guiding space
operations are a correct reflection of the objective laws of space operations and are expanded on by the person guiding
space operations on the basis of understanding the objective laws of space operations. Revealing the objective laws of
space operations is of course important, but the most commendable thing is to draft a series of countermeasures for
defeating the enemy that correspond to the objective laws of space operations, that is, the laws for guiding space
operations.

3. The details that are studied in the science of space operations

As a comprehensive discipline of military theory, the science of space operations touches on a great many of modern
advanced theories and technologies, such as dynamics, systems science, aerospace science, cybernetics, information
theory, new materials technology, information technology, artificial intelligence technology, and biotechnology, forming
specific categories of research. The main details to be studied in the science of space operations are concepts and
connotations related to space and space operations, and the status, nature, targets of study, methods of study, and
system of scientific theories of the science of space operations; living conditions and developmental trends in space
operations; the main characteristics, guiding thoughts, and basic principles of space operations, as well as the
organization and execution, command and control, and overall support for space operations actions; the forms, means, and
measures of space operations and the interrelationships and coordination and cooperation among these; the structure,
buildup, and developmental trends of space operations strengths; the developmental trends and focus of development of
space operations technology as well as the developmental principles of space operations weapons and equipment; the
organization and carrying out of training and support for space operations; and the theory of space operations within
joint operations.

# II. The main characteristics of the science of space operations...17

The science of space operations emerged against the background of mankind’s stepping into the Space Age, of the
widespread applications of space technology and equipment in the exploration of space, and of space confrontations
becoming an important detail in

military confrontations; thus it has the prominent characteristics of having a pioneering nature, of penetration, of
having a composite nature, and of openness.

# 1. A pioneering nature

Although space operations have gone through the differing seminal, formative, and developmental stages, ascending the
stage of warfare as a completely new form of operations, have displayed powerful fascination, and the theories of space
operations regulations, doctrine, and scope have also continually been established and improved in the practices of
space operations, still, looking at things from the angle of guiding overall space operations practices, the systemized
research of the theory of space operations has yet to achieve breakthrough results. The establishment of the science of
space operations not only absorbed in a widespread manner the “flowering” of studies into space operations in a
theoretical manner and scientifically integrated these, so that it refined them and formed theoretical results that were
systematic and integrated, but it also focused on the pressing needs of military conflict in space, actively exploring
and carefully demonstrating things, thus creating theoretical precedents in the science of space operations, and it had
milestone significance in the developmental process of space operations. Therefore, the science of space operations has
combined theoretical innovations with academic innovation into one; this is a groundbreaking discipline that fills
blanks in military theory. To be sure, it will be hard to avoid some immaturities in the science of space operations, as
a newborn thing, but it has exuberant vitality, and as long as it has meticulous nurturing, it will inevitably gradually
stride toward maturity.

# 2. Penetration

As a completely new form of operations, space operations are daily becoming fused into informationized operations, they
are being combined and used with other forms of operations, linked together overall, and with their abilities improved
and made more effective, thus bringing into play their increasingly important role. The extension of space operations to
other forms of operations has resulted in the science of space operations penetrating other corresponding disciplines.
The science of space operations not only needs to study the theories within the system of space operations, such as [the
theories of] command, organizational systems, actions, and support, but it also needs to study the theories of command,
organizational systems, actions, and support when space operations are combined and used with the other forms of
operations, in order to meet the needs of fusing space operations into joint operations actions, and thus having the
science of space operations exhibit fairly strong penetration.

# 3. A composite nature

Space operations are operational practices that touch on very broad areas and that require theoretical knowledge in many
aspects as their support. As a refinement of space operations practices and experiences and a summary of theoretical
knowledge, the science of space operations has a fairly strong composite nature. Not only does it have details from
social sciences, but it also has elements of natural science. For example, space operations’ operations technology and
the quantified evaluation of the results of operations touch on the theories and methods of natural sciences; not only
are the theories and methods of military history and military philosophy used to explain the laws of space operations,
but the theories and methods of the science of strategy, the science of military logistics, and the science of
operational command are used to study the command of space operations. [Also,] not only are the theories and methods of
military geography, the science of the operational environment, and the science of military spaceflight used to study
the operational environment, but the theories and methods of military management and military logistics are used to
study support for space operations. These fully show that the science of space operations incorporates the theoretical
knowledge of a number of disciplines and that it has a very strong composite nature.

# 4. Openness

The science of space operations’ adaptation to dynamic developments in space operations and its organic interaction with
other disciplines and results evince its characteristic of openness; it continually draws fresh nourishment from the
practices of space operations, from other disciplines, and from foreign military’s theories and practices, in order to
enrich and develop the theory of space operations. The rapid development of space operations technology and the
continual advances in the practices of space operations have caused activities in space operations to always be
dynamically developing and to continually provide the science of space operations with a source of practices for
innovative development. Updates to and developments in the theories of other, relevant disciplines have enabled the
science of space operations to draw nourishment from them, to be digested and transformed into details of the science of
space operations, and it is possible [for the science of space operations] to learn beneficial study methods from them.
Beneficial experiences and advanced theories of foreign militaries’ space operations have enabled the science of space
operations to continually absorb valuable theoretical results. At the same time, the tendency in the science of space
operations to be highly composite and to differentiate things will, on the one hand, impel people to have a more
systematic and more in-depth overall knowledge of space operations, while on the other hand it will impel people to have
more concrete and more professional studies of the branch areas of space operations, and the branch disciplines will be
incrementally

generated and continually added to. Thus, openness and drawing upon everyone’s strong points has resulted in the science
of space operations being always placed in a process of continual enrichment and improvement.

# III. The system of theories of the science of space operations...19

One of the important marks of the existence of an independent discipline is that it has a complete system of theories.
This system of theories usually consists of certain interrelated theory units, in accordance with a certain logical
structure; these comprehensively reflect the essential characteristics of the target of study and cover all the details
in the sphere of study. The system of theories in the science of space operations differentiates the basic details in
the science of space operations in accordance with the knowledge structure made by their properties and innate
relationships, in addition to which it arranges and combines by category the structure of systems and levels that is
formed. Based on the targets of study in the science of space operations and the particularities of their details, it is
possible to differentiate the system of theories of the science of space operations into three levels: basic theory,
applied theory, and technical theory.

1. Basic theory

Basic theory in space operations is theory that involves the basic laws of space operations and the basic laws for
guiding [these operations]. Its primary details include the targets, tasks, details, and methods of study in the science
of space operations; the generation and development of space operations; the space operations environment; space
operations strengths; space operations weapons and equipment; the guiding principles of space operations; command and
control of space operations; combat methods in space operations; support for space operations; resource management for
space operations; evaluation of the results of space operations; education and training for space operations;
mobilization for space operations; the rules for space operations; and political work for space operations.

An in-depth study of the basic theory of space operations can fully recognize the phenomenon and form of this objective
thing [that is] space operations; reveal the essential factors of its existence, its main contradictions, and its
developmental laws; and thus form an extremely basic and comprehensive rational knowledge of space operations. Because
what basic theory in space operations seeks for and reflects is the phenomena and laws that universally exist in the
practices of space operations, and [because] it requires the manifestation of ordinarily principles related to space
operations, in an accurate, complete, and in-depth manner, basic theory therefore has a high degree of

abstractness and relative stability, and it has an important guiding role for applied theory and technical theory in
space operations.

# 2. Applied theory

Applied theory in space operations turns basic theory into something concrete, in regard to the characteristics, laws,
and laws for guiding space operations under differing types, differing levels, differing forms, and differing conditions
of operations, and it directly guides the actions of space operations. Its primary contents include space operations
theory for joint firepower attacks, space operations theory for joint blockade campaigns, space operations theory for
joint island offensive campaigns, space operations theory for joint border counterattack campaigns, and space operations
theory for joint anti-space raid campaigns.

An in-depth study of the applied theory of space operations can reveal laws that unify subjective guidance with
objective reality in the process of space operations, forming a complete set of guiding tenets and measures for
enhancing the benefits of operations and buildup, and thus closely combining theory and reality and better guiding space
operations and their buildup. Because what applied theory in space operations studies and resolves is laws for guidance
and methods of implementation that have a common nature in the practices of space operations and their buildup, with a
focus on resolving current and developing actual problems, applied theory in space operations therefore has a clear
purposefulness, a scientific predictability, a sharp relevance, and very strong operability.

# 3. Technical theory

Technical theory in space operations is the overall mechanisms and overall developmental laws related to space
operations technology, with a focus on studying the principles and methods of the formation, use, building, and
development of space operations technology, and it plays the role of a technical prop and assistance and support for
space operations basic theory and applied theory. Its main contents include two parts: basic technology for space
operations and applied technology for space operations.

The basic technology for space operations primarily includes: spacecraft technology, technology for the use and control
of spacecraft, applied technology for spacecraft, technology for space launch vehicles, launch technology for
spacecraft, space tracking technology, and manned spaceflight technology.

The applied technology for space operations primarily includes technology that is applied to carrying out and supporting
space offensive and defensive operations, such as delivery into space, perception of the space situation, offensive
space attack and defense, and defensive space attack and defense. Of these, offensive space attack and defense
technology includes space weapons technology (including space weapons platforms technology and space weapons payload
technology), anti-satellite technology (nuclearpowered anti-satellite technology, kinetic energy anti-satellite
technology, laser antisatellite technology, microwave anti-satellite technology, particle beam anti-satellite
technology, direct ascent-type intercept technology, and rail-type intercept technology), space information
confrontation technology, soft-kill technology, and hard-kill technology; defensive space attack and defense technology
includes satellite-borne false target technology, spacecraft protection reinforcement technology, orbital movement
technology, and rapid reconstruction technology.

# IV. The relationship between the science of space operations and other disciplines...21

The science of space operations is not an isolated discipline; rather, it exists within the grand system of all military
science, and it and the other disciplines in military science and even in natural science and social science affect one
another, penetrate one another, and restrict one another, and [together] they continually advance forward. The study of
the relationship between the science of space operations and related disciplines helps to clarify the position that the
science of space operations holds within all of military science as well as the role that it plays there, and to have a
clear idea of the impact that theories from relevant disciplines have on the science of space operations.

1. The relationships with the science of strategy, the science of campaigns, and the science of tactics

Space operations permeate each level of strategy, campaigns, and tactics; the science of space operations penetrates the
sciences of strategy, campaigns, and tactics, while the sciences of strategy, campaigns, and tactics are reflected in
the science of space operations. The science of strategy is science that relates to the overall war situation; it
studies macroscopic issues in military theory, and it affects and restricts the building and development of other
military disciplines. The science of strategy and the science of space operations form a relationship of guiding and
being guided. The science of strategy provides the study of the science of space operations with a theoretical
foundation that [covers] the entire situation and that is high-level, and brings into play the role of macroscopic
guidance; the science of space operations determines the direction and tasks of relevant studies for its own discipline,
based on the overall requirements of the academic theories of the science of strategy, thus deepening the theoretical
studies of its own discipline and better serving the preparations for and execution of space operations.

Developments in the theory and practices of space operations will also further enrich the theories on military conflict
and armed forces building in the science of strategy, thus promoting the development of academic theory in the science
of strategy. The science of campaign and the science of tactics are disciplines affecting the laws of campaigns and
combats and the laws for guiding these. The science of space operations is closely related to the science of campaigns
and the science of tactics; they affect one another and supplement each other. On the one hand, changes and developments
in the theories of campaigns and tactics directly affect and promote changes and developments in theories of space
campaigns, filling out and improving the science of space operations; on the other hand, the theoretical results of the
science of space operations and especially the results of combat methods that are generated in the practices of space
operations, can enrich the theories of campaigns and tactics, and promote their further development.

2. The relationships with the science of joint operations, the science of operational command, and the science of the
operational environment

The science of joint operations is the discipline that studies the laws of joint operations and the laws for guiding
[joint operations]. The science of joint operations and the science of space operations respectively have joint
operations and space operations as the targets of their studies. As regards their forms and methods, joint operations
and space operations have similarities, and in looking at them in a certain sense, joint operations include space
operations, while space operations reflect joint operations in a special form. Therefore, there is a clear overlap
between the science of space operations and the science of joint operations, and the two can learn from each other,
interact, and develop in a synchronized manner.

The science of operational command is the discipline that studies the laws of operational command and the practices that
guide operational command. The science of operational command uses command activities for operations as the target of
its studies in order to reveal the general laws for operational command, to explore and point out directions for
theoretical studies and practices by space operations commanders and command organs, and to promote the development of
command theory and practices for space operations, and the results of the command theory and practices in space
operations also continually enrich and develop the theory of operational command.

The science of the operational environment is the discipline that studies the laws of the operational environment, which
guides people in carrying out operational practices within differing environments. The science of the operational
environment primarily studies the effect that the environment has on operational actions and guides people to correctly
understand, master, and use various types of objective environments, in order to enhance the effectiveness of
operations. The science of the operational environment is the study and revelation of the essence, characteristics, and
laws of the environment, and it has a definite role in drawing lessons through theoretical studies of the space
operations environment; the results of theoretical studies by the science of space operations of its special operational
environment also will enrich and improve the science of the operational environment.

3. The relationships with the science of military information, the science of military spaceflight, the science of armed
forces building, and the science of military equipment

The science of military information is the discipline that studies the laws of military information and the laws for
using [this information], and that guides the military information building and its uses in actual combat. Looking at
the details of this study, the science of military information merges with the details of the science of space
operations, and they influence each other; moreover, there exists to a certain extent a relationship where they guide
and are guided by [each other]. The science of military information has a universal significance for guiding the results
of theoretical studies of the essence, characteristics, and laws of military information and of other disciplines,
including the science of space operations, as well as value as something to learn from. The science of space operations
has an important role in enriching and developing the results of studies of the essence, characteristics, and laws of
space information and for theoretical studies of the science of military information.

The science of military spaceflight is the overall discipline that studies the laws of military spaceflight activities
and that guides the buildup and use of military spaceflight strengths. The details that the science of military
spaceflight studies primarily include the basis of space technology, space strengths, and operations; it forms a
relationship with the science of space operations, where it includes [the science of space operations] and is included
by it. Looking at it in general, the science of space operations basically overlaps with the theory of the use of
spaceflight strengths within the science of military spaceflight. The results of theoretical studies of the science of
military spaceflight have an important value in guiding the science of space operations and as a reference, while the
results of theoretical studies of the science of space operations have a positive significance for enriching and
developing the science of military spaceflight.

The science of armed forces building is the discipline that studies the laws for armed forces building and the laws for
guiding [this buildup], and it is an up-and-coming discipline that has taken shape in order to meet the needs of the
constant developments in military practices and the overall improvements in military science. The science of armed
forces building resulted from studying the essence and characteristics of the armed forces building, and it has a role
as something to learn from in the building of space operations strengths; the general laws for the armed forces building
and the laws for guiding it that the science of armed forces building reveals has a role in guiding the theory of the
building of space operations. The results of theoretical studies in the science of space operations has added new
connotations for the science of armed forces building, and in particular, the theoretical results in the area of the
building of space strengths will enrich and improve the theory of the armed forces building.

The science of military equipment is the discipline that studies the laws of military equipment’s activities and the
laws for guiding military equipment’s work. Military equipment is the physical basis for space operations, and space
operations are operational activities, under corresponding conditions of space military equipment, that people who have
mastered this equipment carry out. The ordinary laws of military equipment activities and the laws for guiding the work
of this equipment that are revealed by the science of military equipment have the role of guiding equipment activities
and the work of equipment in space operations. The study results of the science of space operations regarding the
special laws of equipment activities in space operations and regarding the special laws for guiding the equipment’s work
will promote enhancements and improvements in the theory of military equipment and enrich the theoretical contents of
the science of military equipment.

In summary, as a comprehensive discipline, the science of space operations has a very close relationship with a great
number of other military disciplines. Only by clearly recognizing the interrelationships among these various disciplines
and by actively absorbing the academic nutrients of other military disciplines is it possible to continually enrich,
improve, and ultimately form a system of theories of space operations that has the characteristics of the age.

# Section 3: The Significance of the Creation of the Science of Space Operations, and Its Principles and Methods of Research...23

The science of space operations is a new discipline in the system of theories of military science. In order to ensure
its healthy development and its moves toward maturity, it is necessary to accurately understand the major significance
of the creation of the discipline and the important strategic position that it holds, to strengthen the sense of mission
and sense of urgency in studying it, to have a grasp on the correct direction for studying it, to master scientific
methods of study, to comprehensively improve the ability to study it, to better explore the laws of space operations and
the laws for guiding space operations, and to continually deepen the study of the theory of space operations.

# I. The major significance of the creation of the science of space operations...23

Currently, the struggle that the major world powers have launched centered around dominance over space is increasingly
intense, and they are all actively launching studies into the theory of space operations, energetically strengthening
the building of space operations capabilities, and forming a new situation where they are trying to catch up with one
another and competing for development. Given this kind of background, the creation of the science of space operations
has a very major real significance and an important theoretical value.

1. It is a requirement for guiding the practices of space operations

Ever since mankind entered space, the curtain centered on the struggle for domination of space has been silently drawn
back, and the tendency to develop space militarization has also continually intensified, directly giving birth to space
operations. How to face the ascension onto the stage of war by space operations, this “newborn child,” has become an
urgent and real topic that future informationized operations faces. Since entering the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$
century, the major military powers of the world, and in particular the United States, have vigorously developed space
operations strengths and equipment, and the pace at which [the United States] has enhanced the ability of its space
operations for actual warfare has continually accelerated, continually widening the gap of its advantages over other
nations; the situation is quite compelling. First, the United States withdrew from the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty in
2001, clearing away an obstacle to the National Missile Defense system and to space operations, and it formally deployed
a missile defense system, thus comprehensively launching its space operations plans. It proposed a new strategic plan,
announced a new national policy, and on the basis of summarizing its experiences in space operations in the several
recent local wars, issued a number of space operations doctrines. Moreover, through simulated war games to test and
improve its space operations theories, it strengthened the building of its space troops and actively invested huge funds
in the research of space technology and equipment, putting these into material preparations for space operations. In the
Information Age, victory or defeat in space operations has already become a decisive factor in the success or failure of
warfare. If you want to be put in an unbeatable position in future wars and to win victory in space operations under
informationized conditions, it will be necessary to strengthen your preparations for space operations and to
comprehensively increase the abilities of your space operations. Therefore, the creation of the science of space
operations in order to guide the buildup and use of space operations strengths, has become the only option in the
development of space operations.

2. It is a requirement for improving and developing the theory of military science

Military science is a system of theories that is developing and is open; in general, it has continually developed
alongside the development of science and technology and war practices. With the rapid development and in-depth use of
space technology, the creation of a new and flourishing discipline that corresponds to the status and role of space
operations in informationized warfare – the science of space operations – has become an urgent matter in the improvement
and development of military science. First, the development of space technology and means has laid an objective
foundation for the development of the discipline of space operations. The history of mankind’s research of military
science has shown that the establishment of any new and flourishing discipline must have the development of science and
technology and means of operations as its basis. For example, the theory and discipline of air force operations were
created only when air propulsion technology and combat aircraft had been developed, and the theory and discipline of
nuclear warfare were created only with the development of modern nuclear technology and nuclear weapons. Today, the
increasingly advanced technology and means of space have laid a firm foundation for the creation of the discipline of
space operations. Second, the emergence and use of forms of space operations have levied pressing requirements on the
discipline of space operations. In the local wars since the Gulf War, space operations have quietly mounted the stage of
warfare, and have increasingly highlighted and displayed their enormous power, becoming an important form and action in
informationized warfare; this has urgently required the creation of a military discipline corresponding to this that
would provide it with a theoretical brace. Third, the creation of the discipline of space operations is an inevitable
trend in the development of the system of military sciences. The system of theories for military science has had to
undergo a process of incremental development and continual improvement. In this process of development and improvement,
the existing system of military science theory is clearly lagging, in comparison with the rapidly developing technology
of space operations and its forms of operations. If the system of the discipline of space operations is not added to the
system [of military sciences theories], there will be no way to adapt to the needs of the development of informationized
warfare, and it will also be difficult to form a complete system of military science theories.

3. It is an actual requirement for forging the ranks of space operations persons of talent

In operations under informationized conditions, how high or low the ability of space operations is determines how great
the possibility for winning victory in war is. In these abilities, people are the core key factor. Therefore, building
up the ranks of people of talent has become an important detail for the world’s military powers as they strengthen the
building of their space operations capabilities. If the scale and quality of space

operations weapons and equipment is insufficient, these can be quickly developed within a short period of time, but if
there is a serious lack of scientific and technological and military people of talent or if their overall quality is
low, it will be very difficult to improve the abilities of space operations, and the gap that appears in this sphere
will continually grow. In order to raise the abilities of space operations overall and to fully have the ability to win
a future informationized war, it is necessary to incorporate the buildup of the ranks of space operations persons of
talent into the new model of operational strengths, with a focus on their buildup and speeding up their development.
Speaking basically, space operations are a high-end game of space operations persons of talent. Without a large batch of
high-quality space operations persons of talent, it is impossible to have effective mastery of space operations weapons
and equipment and to innovate combat methods in space operations in a timely manner, and it will also be very difficult
to win victory in future space operations. Strengthening the buildup of space operations persons of talent inevitably
requires launching studies into the theory of space operations, introducing a group of teaching materials on theory as
represented by the science of space operations, giving shape to the discipline of space operations, and supporting the
teaching of space operations theory. Currently, although there have been a number of results in studies on space
operations theory, these are not systematic enough, and they have yet to form a complete system of space operations
theory. Against this background, creating the science of space operations appears to be particularly urgent.

# II. Principles of study in the science of space operations...25

As a groundbreaking theoretical discipline, the science of space operations not only needs to summarize and refine the
theories and practices of space operations that it already has, but even more, it needs to combine these with what is
real, so as to serve actual combat, and to correctly lead and guide theoretical studies and practical explorations in
space operations. This places very heavy demands on the issue of studying space operations, and requires continually
holding to the principles of holism, practicality, innovation, and rolling along with things.

1. The principle of holism

The principle of holism means keeping an eye on forming and completing systems of theories of space operations systems;
proceeding from the overall situation, it not only carries out in-depth analysis of each part and each link in space
operations, but it also carries out a systematic integration of the relations among the various parts and the various
links. As theoretical knowledge of the systems of space operations, the science of space operations covers every aspect
of space operations, from operations to support, from technology to tactics, from equipment to persons of talent, and
from building up to use; it involves each level, from strategy to campaigns to tactics, and from setups to systems to
key factors, and it is linked to a great amount of academic knowledge, such as the science of joint operations, the
science of operational command, the science of military spaceflight, and the knowledge of information operations .
Therefore, in the process of studying the science of space operations, it is necessary to hold fast to the principle of
holism. In holding to this principle, it is necessary on the one hand to widely collect the results of relevant
theoretical studies of space operations and practical explorations, in order to come to an understanding of the entire
system of space operations; on the other hand, it is necessary to hold to an epistemological viewpoint, to adopt the
method of overall analysis, and on the basis of in-depth analysis of each aspect and each link in space operations, to
carry out systematic study and to strive to reveal the complete picture of space operations.

# 2. The principle of practicality

The principle of practicality means focusing on effective service to the development of space operations, with
pragmatism as the criteria, in order to launch studies into space operations. Putting studies to use is a basic
requirement in theoretical studies. Only by originating from practice, by serving practice, by being tested by practice,
and by enriching practice, can any theoretical studies truly manifest their value and have a vigorous vitality. As a
systematic theory that guides practices in space operations, the science of space operations must be close to practices
and must strive to be pragmatic. Moreover, as a newborn thing, space operations’ need for theoretical guidance by truly
effective theory is particularly urgent. Given this background, studies in the theory of space operation have an even
greater need to hold fast to the principle of practicality. In holding to this principle, it is necessary on the one
hand to have an understanding and grasp of how foreign militaries’ space operations are developing, in a comprehensive,
systematic, and accurate manner, and to analyze and summarize their experience and lessons, and thus propose valuable
theoretical viewpoints; on the other hand, it is necessary to go deep into the practices of space operations, and to
combine these with reality, to pinpoint heavy difficulties in space operations, and to propose countermeasure that are
truly effective.

# 3. The principle of innovation

The principle of innovation means focusing on developments in space operations that leap ahead, combining these with the
specific requirements of operations, daring to break past results that have already been studied, and creating and
forming a system of theories of space operations that have their own characteristics. The new characteristics of space
operations have determined that theoretical studies of space operations must have

innovation. In particular, the militaries of countries whose space operations started late, whose foundation is weak,
whose scale is small, and whose abilities are weak, and that develop step by step in a way that follows after [those
that are more advanced] will find it difficult to gain the initiative in space operations; they must exert themselves to
bring into play the advantages of being the ones who are behind, and develop in a way where they leap ahead. For this
reason, it is first necessary to dare to make breakthroughs in theoretical studies, and to continually use “new
tactics,” “unusual tactics,” and “deadly tactics,” thus forming theories that have their own characteristics and can
effectively guide space operations, in order to guide the practices of space operations to develop in an extraordinary
manner. In holding fast to this principle, it is necessary on the one hand to conscientiously study the current state of
developments in space operations in today’s world, in particular the strong points and weak points of the space
operations of the main opponent in operations, and in accordance with the thinking of asymmetrical development, to
propose relevant countermeasures; on the other hand, it is necessary to actively use advanced means of simulation
technology in order to launch probes into practices in space operations that are done in advance, and to propose, test,
and improve new theoretical viewpoints.

# 4. The principle of rolling along with things

The principle of rolling along with things means closely following developments in practices in space operations and
continually enriching and improving the theory of space operations. Dialectical materialism believes that all things are
perpetually in the midst of constant movement and changes, and that the laws for the movement of things and the laws for
guiding [this movement] also must be constantly enriched and developed. Given that space operations are a completely new
form of operations that has appeared under informationized conditions, their role is highlighted and their development
is rapid, and the concomitant science of space operations has also became a new and flourishing discipline, which
requires constant enrichment and development in its practices. Therefore, the study of the science of space operations
requires holding fast to the principle of rolling along with things. Holding to this principle requires, on the one
hand, closely following the newest dynamics in the development of space operations and combining this with your own
realities in the development of space operations, thus finding and studying new issues and proposing new theories; on
the other hand, it is necessary to systematically comb through, screen, and combine new theoretical results that are
continually studied and proposed, and to supplement and improve the system of theories of space operations in a timely
manner.

# III. Study methods for the science of space operations...27

In the process of studying the science of space operations, it is necessary to hold fast to the methodology of
historical materialism and dialectical materialism, and to adopt forms where theory is combined with practice and where
quality is combined with quantity. Commonly used methods primarily consist of the systematic study method, the method of
studying examples of battles, the comparative study method, the method of learning from others’ theories, the simulation
testing method, and the exercise and testing method.

1. The systematic study method

The science of space operations comes under the science of operations, it is restrained by and led by the science of
strategy and the science of joint operations, and it is closely connected to other disciplines. Therefore, it is
necessary to proceed overall from military science, to look at the overall situation, to penetrate from above downwards,
and to carry out systematized study; the science of space operations cannot be studied in isolation. At the same time,
given that the science of space operations is an independent discipline with a complete system, its various internal
knowledge units are closely connected. In studying the science of space operations, it is also necessary to proceed in a
holistic manner from the science of space operations, to use the method of systems theory, and to study the various
parts in this system and their interrelationships, as well as their relations with external factors. These kinds of
relations are regular. Even if you are studying a given specific issue in studying the science of space operations, you
should also observe and study this issue within the grand system that is the science of space operations, before you are
able to stand at a higher level and grasp the specific issue macroscopically, and to thus avoid studies that are
one-sided, isolated, and dispersed.

2. The method of studying examples of battles

What is referred to as the method of studying examples of battles is the method of study that finds particular patterns
in differing operations that have occurred in the past, by analyzing and studying their practices, and then afterwards
abstracting general laws from out of these particular patterns. The $1 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } } \ .$ century capitalist
military theoretician [AntoineHenri] Jomini said, “The only rational basis in the theory of all skills in warfare is the
study of history.” Napoleon [Bonaparte] pointed out that a qualified military commander must conscientiously study
eighty-three wars commanded by seven famous commandersin-chief, such as Alexander, Hannibal, and [Julius] Caesar. In
this way, he can write these into a complete study guide for the art of operations. Studying the science of space
operations is no exception; in the same way, it requires using the method of analyzing examples of battles in order to
systematically study the evolution and development of

space operations as well as famous examples of battles, thus understanding and getting a grasp on the basic laws of
space operations. When studying examples of battles, it is necessary to pay attention to using modern and advanced
theory and methods, and to consider these from many angles and many levels, so as to seek to see what people of old did
not see. However, any experience will have certain limitations, and it is necessary to follow the principle where what
has been inherited from the past is united with innovation, and to combine this with the realities of units’
organizational structure and equipment, in order to actively and courageously search for new theories; you cannot obsess
over successful experiences of the past, but must always maintain a flourishing vitality in the science of space
operations.

# 3. The comparative study method

Comparison is a logical method of thinking that carries out a comparative analysis of a given category of things, in
order to determine the points of difference between things or their points in common. By using the comparative method in
the study of the theory of space operations, it is possible to open up your field of vision through comparison. By means
of an in-depth study of the theory of space operations, it is possible to seek a path for the development of space
operations as well as future trends, through scanning history, and it is possible to reveal the objective laws of space
operations and the laws for guiding these, against a broader strategic background. In using the comparative method to
study the theory of space operations, the first thing is to carry out a horizontal comparison. For example, compare such
key factors within the same period of time as the various countries’ space operations weapons and equipment, their space
operations exercises, their space operations combat methods, and their ability to guide space operations. The second
thing is to carry out a vertical comparison. That is, launch a dynamic comparison of the same key factor in space
operations in accordance with vertical sections of a time sequence. For example, when studying combat methods of space
operations, you can reveal the laws of development of space operations combat methods by carrying out a vertical
comparison of the combat methods that were used in the local wars that have taken place in the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h }
}$ and $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ centuries. The third thing is to carry out qualitative and quantitative comparisons.
For example, when analyzing the space operations capabilities of the two hostile sides, it is not only necessary to
quantitatively compare the various key factors that compose space operations, in order to accurately judge the
differences in their numbers, but it is also necessary to carry out a qualitative analysis of their space operations
capabilities, and to fully consider the many factors that cannot be quantitatively calculated, including the human
factor, so as to reach accurate conclusions.

4. The method of learning from others’ theories

What is referred to as the method of learning from others’ theories is a method of study that learns from the beneficial
parts of foreign militaries’ theories of operations and of other neighboring or related disciplines, through studying
and researching the details of [these theories], in order to enrich and improve the theory of space operations.
Militaries are divided up according to countries, and the practices of space operations are differentiated by region or
level, but the essence of space operations does not change because of this; this has also determined that the space
operations theories of the various countries’ militaries have identical or similar details. The advanced theories of
space operations of foreign militaries have quite important roles in elevating the starting points for studies in their
own countries’ space operations theories and for speeding up innovations in their space operations theories. Therefore,
in studying the science of space operations, you should pay attention to absorbing the quintessence of foreign
militaries’ space operations theories, in order to enrich and improve the PRC military’s system of theories in the
science of space operations. At the same time, although related and neighboring disciplines differ as regards their
spheres of study, still, they in essence investigate the characteristics of operational practices from differing angles
or aspects, and to a certain extent they reflect the essence and basic laws of operations, so that they play a certain
positive role in studying the theory of the science of space operations. Of course, studying and learning from foreign
militaries’ theories of space operations and from the theories of neighboring and related disciplines must firmly hold
to a Marxist position; use historical, comprehensive, and developmental viewpoints; and proceed from reality, learning
from these and absorbing them with an attitude of seeking truth from facts and of discarding [what is not applicable].

# 5. The simulation testing method

What is referred to as the simulation testing method is a method of study that comprehensively utilizes such modern
information technology means as distributed interactive modeling technology, virtual reality technology, and artificial
intelligence technology to study the theory of space operations. By using this method, it is possible to merge
generalizations of historical experiences and predictions of the future into one, and to combine qualitative analysis
with quantitative analysis and [combine] analytic calculation with process simulation; moreover, it is also possible to
create lifelike operational environments and battle laboratories that are close to actual warfare, through synthetic
dynamic artificial simulated battlefields, so that the results of theoretical studies will be in even greater accord
with the needs of actual warfare. Currently, the use of the simulation test method to study information operations
theory primarily should do a good job of evaluating the effectiveness of space operations weapons systems, evaluating
the effectiveness of space operations actions, and studying and using space operations simulations and emulations as
well as intelligent decision-making systems. For example, when evaluating the effectiveness of space operations actions,
it is possible to use computer systems to describe space operations strengths and plans of actions, and to carry out
scientific calculations about the effectiveness of operational actions, and it is possible to use emulation technology
to simulate battlefield environments and space operations actions in a lifelike manner, thus providing a support
platform for evaluating the effectiveness of space operations. Through evaluations of space operations plans of action,
[it is possible] to find problems and to seek methods for resolving [these problems], in order to further improve
programs and plans for space operations actions.

6. The exercise and testing method

What is referred to as the exercise and testing method is a method that examines and tests the accuracy of space
operations theory, through purposeful and planned practical activities for exercises, and that gets experiences and data
that are similar to actual combat. Mature operational theory, forms and methods of using weapons and equipment, and ways
to generate combat forces and bring their role into play, must all undergo corresponding practical activities in order
to test their scientific nature and rationality. In particular, the applied theory part of the system of space
operations theory must undergo practical activities that are basically consistent with corresponding subjective and
objective conditions before it is possible to fairly accurately test the differences between [theories] and actual
operations, in order to further improve and implement them. Although space operations practices are used to test
corresponding theories, and their results are the most real, still, because the costs are too expensive and they are not
controlled by subjective will, they do not help in studying and investigating the theory of space operations. Space
operations exercises can overcome these shortcomings in an effective manner. Not only do they not require a fairly large
investment, but they can also simulate the effectiveness of actual space operations, and thus they make it possible to
test the newest results of studies of space operations theory, and they are one of the important methods for studying
the science of space operations in peacetime.

# Lecture 2 Characteristics, Guiding Thought, and Basic Principles of Space Operations...31

Characteristics are an external reflection of essence. Revealing the main characteristics of space operations is very
important for an in-depth study of the essence of space operations and for exploring the general laws of space
operations. And the guiding thought and principles of space operations are a product where subjective guidance of space
operations abides by the objective laws of space operations and fully brings its dynamism into play, they are rational
knowledge overall of the guiding laws for space operations, and they are the basic foundation and principles for
preparing for and carrying out space operations. Studying the characteristics of space operations and establishing
correct guiding thought and principles have an important significance for enriching the theory of space operations and
for guiding the practices of space operations.

# Section 1: The Main Characteristics of Space Operations...31

Space operations are a completely new form of operations, established on the basis of the high levels to which military
space technology has developed. Their special battlefield situation, battlefield environment, weapons and equipment,
forms of operations, and special operational goals give them distinct characteristics that differ from other forms of
operations.

# I. Battlefield spaces are broad, and confrontation is intense...31

Battlefield spaces of space operations refers to the spaces in which the two hostile sides engage in space operations
activities. Space battlefields, in the narrow sense, are a hollow sphere whose lower interface is 100 kilometers above
the surface of the earth and whose upper interface is 930,000 kilometers above the center of the earth; this is also
called outer space. Space battlefields in the broad sense also include the atmospheric and land (or sea) areas and
information spaces that are required for engaging in space operations activities. The battlefield spaces of space
operations, compared to operations on land, at sea, and in the air, have a broader scope and a more intense level of
confrontation.

Based on the current state and trends in the development of human space technology, as well as the distribution of
orbits for military spacecraft, space operations platforms and their weapons and equipment will primarily be deployed
and used in outer space, now and for a fairly long period of time in the future, and operational actions also will be
launched centered on the control and use of this space; at the same time, [space operations] will deprive the opponent
of freedom of action in this space, or weaken [this freedom]. Therefore, given that outer space is the main battlefield
in space operations, the two hostile sides will inevitably make comprehensive use of both soft and hard means of attack
to directly engage in offensive and defensive confrontations in space. The level of confrontation will be quite intense.

In space operations, the outer space battlefield will be closely linked to the traditional land and sea battlefields, by
means of the atmosphere. It will be easy for space operations platforms to be intercepted and attacked by the opponent’s
space offensive weapons when transiting the atmosphere, and it will also be easy for radar, imaging, reconnaissance and
other devices to be jammed and deceived by airborne radar jammers and fake targets. Therefore, given that the atmosphere
will be an important channel for space operations and at the same time an important battlefield for engaging in space
operations, the two hostile sides inevitably will adopt means for engaging in confrontations in order to ensure that
their own side’s passage through the atmosphere is secure and unimpeded.

The ground is the basic support for engaging in space operations, and it plays a crucially important role in the overall
system of operations. The command and control organization, launch sites, control units, and service and support units
for space operations are mainly located on the earth, and destroying the opponent’s space ground facilities can greatly
weaken or destroy his ability for space operations. At the same time, the locations of ground bases are relatively fixed
and their defensive capabilities are fairly weak, so that it is easy for them to come under various kinds of attacks.
Therefore, land battlefields are key battlefields for the two hostile sides’ attack and defense, and the confrontation
will inevitably be quite intense.

Information has become a crucial key factor for victory in warfare, and information spaces are places that space
operations will inevitably fight over. Future space operations will be mainly manifested as space information support;
also, they will control various kinds of spacecraft and release operations energy from various kinds of space weapons
systems, by means of control over information flow, thus enhancing the overall effectiveness of operations in space
operations systems. Struggling for dominance in space information will inevitably become a focus of operational actions,
and the two hostile sides will inevitably mobilize all means to cut off information links between the opponent’s space
and other battlefield spaces. Therefore, the two combatants’ powerful struggle for space information dominance will
inevitably increase the level of intensity in information confrontations.

# II. Weapons and equipment technology will be highly concentrated...32

The core of weapons and equipment technology in space operations is military space technology; it is integrated systems
technology that delivers unmanned or manned spacecraft into outer space and uses the spacecraft to explore, exploit, and
use outer space and the earth as well as celestial bodies beyond the globe. Military space technology also can be
understood as military technology for studying, designing, creating, testing, launching, using, recovering, controlling,
and using space systems.

Military space technology is an important symbol of the levels of a nation’s science and technology and of the power of
its national economy; it represents the highest level of a nation’s military-industrial and scientific and technological
development. At the same time, military space technology is complex and sophisticated science and technology; it
contains humanity’s huge abilities for wisdom and innovation; it comprehensively utilizes the results of mankind’s
research over the past several hundred years into a number of areas, such as military science, astronomy, physics,
chemistry, mathematics, biology, and medicine, and it also has only been able to develop with the close support of the
various related disciplines. Therefore, military science technology is a highly integrated technology; it concentrates
the large number of today’s basic sciences and advanced and new technologies, and it touches on almost all of the newest
basic sciences and technologies. Military space technology includes the world’s most sophisticated and advanced
technologies today, such as design and manufacturing technology for such spacecraft and space vehicles as carrier
rockets, satellites, spaceships, space stations, space shuttles, and space planes; carrier rocket and spacecraft
experiments, rocket guidance and control, spacecraft launches, monitoring and control and recovery technology;
spacecraft information gathering and processing and space science engineering technology; and new-concept weapons
technology, microelectronics technology, new materials and new energy technology, and huge intelligent computers. Its
main subject areas include aerodynamics, aerospace dynamics, spacecraft manufacturing technology, space thermodynamics,
the science of space materials, the science of spaceflight, space systems engineering, and management science. This thus
forms a huge and complex group of advanced technologies.

As physical achievements in the military sphere of space technology, space weapons and equipment systems make integrated
use of such results of advanced and new technology as information technology, space technology, new materials, new
energy sources, and artificial intelligence technology; the high levels of complexity, automation, and intelligence in
their structures and the intensity of the demands that they place on operational and support personnel, are things that
the weapons and equipment of other battlefields, like land, sea, and air, cannot compare with. Space weapons and
equipment systems consist of military spacecraft, space transportation systems, spacecraft launch and recovery systems,
space monitoring and control, communications systems, and applications systems, as well as space defense systems. As the
heart of space weapons and equipment, military spacecraft generally consist of structural systems, thermal control
systems, power systems, orbital and attitude control systems, tracking systems, remote telemetry systems, communications
systems, and data management systems, as well as dedicated payload systems. Recovery-type spacecraft also need to be
equipped with recovery and landing systems, and manned spacecraft also have environmental control, life support, and
emergency rescue systems. The design and manufacture of military spacecraft touch on spacecraft design and manufacturing
technology; carrier rocket design and manufacturing technology; rocket and spacecraft and flight environment simulation
technology; jet propulsion technology; spacecraft thermal control technology; spacecraft power technology; rocket
guidance and control technology; spacecraft launch, monitoring and control, and recovery technology; space sensor,
communications, and navigation technology; and space-based new-concept weapons technology, thus concentrating the
culmination of today’s advanced and new technology results. The United States’ Apollo moon landing project mobilized
more than 20,000 businesses, over 200 universities, and more than thirty scientific research organizations, with over
300,000 personnel participating; the amount of its technological content, the intensity of its reliance on science and
technology, and the greatness of its technological difficulties were something that other military projects could not
compare with.

Therefore, space operations strengths must include a group of scientists and experts who are well-versed in and adept at
space technology, and a group of command personnel and combat personnel who have undergone special fostering and
training, before they can be competent at the arduous missions of space operations.

# III. Operations deployment will be highly dispersed...34

Space operations strengths not only consist of offensive and defensive strengths that are deployed in outer space, but
they also consist of ground strengths that are provided for supporting the smooth execution of space operations; they
consist of not only space operations strengths that have an organized structure, but they also consist of civilian
strengths that are temporarily requisitioned; and they consist of “hard kill” strengths as well as “soft kill”
strengths. The technical and tactical performance of space operations strengths and the patterns of their use cause
deployments for space operations to exhibit characteristics that integrate multiple dimensions and are highly dispersed;
this is something that other services’ operational strengths do not have.

Looking at the requirements for building a system of space operations, space operations consist of three tasks:
awareness of the space situation, defensive space operations, and offensive space operations. Systems for awareness of
the space situation consist of ground-based detection equipment, space-based detection equipment, and command and
control centers; the types of weapons are divided into kinetic energy weapons, laser weapons, microwave weapons, and
particle beam weapons, and the entire space system is also divided into a space section, a linking section, and a ground
section. The targets for space defense are not only orbiting satellites, but they also include linking satellites
{lianlu weixing}, earth stations, and operational personnel. Because the functions and performance of all these systems,
deployed over the broad space battlefield, differ and [because] they are deployed in a dispersed manner over the space
battlefield, it is only through overall integration and being merged with each other that they can form a complete
system of space operations.

Looking at space spacecraft, these are distributed in many levels of orbits; most orbits are circular orbits or
near-circular orbits (with an orbital eccentricity of close to zero). Circular orbits usually are divided into three
major types, in accordance with their altitude: low orbits (100 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers), medium orbits (1,000
kilometers to 20,000 kilometers), and high orbits (above 20,000 kilometers). Military or dual military-civilian manned
spacecraft, such as manned spaceships, space stations, space shuttles, and space planes, generally operate in low
orbits, below 500 kilometers.

Looking at the disposition of space [bases] and space defense bases on the ground, the special requirements for
spacecraft launches, monitoring and control and recovery, and space defense operational actions have determined that the
disposition of space [bases] and space defense bases on the ground is highly dispersed; space launch sites generally are
selected in inland deserts and grasslands, or in coastal areas where the geographical latitude is relatively low, where
the population is sparse, that are easy to defend, and where the geology, water sources, terrain, traffic, and weather
conditions are appropriate. In order to ensure that there is effective measurements and control over spacecraft during
the process of their launch, during their operations in orbit, and during the retrieval of recovery-type spacecraft, a
number of monitoring and control stations are set up along the route for the launch section of the spacecraft, in the
navigation area of the spacecraft, and in the landing area of recovery-type spacecraft, forming a space monitoring and
control network over a broad scope and even across the entire globe. The long-range early warning radar network,
anti-missile, and anti-spacecraft missile launch sites for space defense units on the ground generally are deployed in
in-depth echelon along the main operational direction for incoming attacks by enemy ballistic missiles and space-based
weapons platforms, in order to increase the chances of discovering [these] and the number of firepower in-depth
interceptions, and they are also highly dispersed.

# IV. Operational actions are rapid, precise, and highly effective...35

The extremely powerful operational capabilities that space military strengths have for detection and awareness, for
rapid movement, for long-range attacks, and for surprise attacks have made it possible to concentrate and release space
operations’ effectiveness within a very short period of time. Therefore, compared to other operations, the rhythm of
space operations has clearly accelerated, and their process has clearly been shortened. At the same time, the
characteristic that space operations weapons and equipment have of being informationized and their powerful destructive
capabilities, as well as the diversification of the means of space operations, have determined that space operations
strengths can carry out their various operational tasks in a rapid, precision, and highly effective manner.

On land, sea, and air battlefields, the speed of movement of weapons and equipment is several dozen meters or several
hundred meters a second, while the speed at which shells fired by firearms fly is several hundred meters or several
kilometers per second. But in space warfare, the speed at which space operations strengths move and the speed at which
they are projected is greatly increased; the flight speed of spacecraft can reach several kilometers a second and the
speed at which directed energy weapons and laser weapons operate reaches 300,000 kilometers a second, which respectively
are an increase of several dozen times to up to 10,000 times the speed of movement and projection in the air. They can
instantaneously attack targets across the entire globe. This has increased surprise in space operations to an
unprecedented extent, the strategic early warning time has been shortened, and battlefield situations change in the
twinkling of an eye. When engaged in space warfare, only by reacting rapidly is it possible to have a grasp on fleeting
opportunities for battle. The acceleration of the rhythm of space operations has consequently led to major changes in
the interrelationship between time and space. In space operations, time has shown a tendency to increase in value, and
the size of national territory and strategic depths has become unimportant as a restraining factor, so that it will be
hard to achieve goals by trading space for time, while using time to struggle for space will become a new strategic
choice. The characteristic of speed that space operations actions have covers the entire process of real-time discovery,
real-time command and control, real-time actions, and real-time evaluation and feedback. In this, real-time discovery is
the precondition, real-time command and control are the key, realtime action is the core, and real-time evaluation and
feedback are the basis for follow-up actions. In space operations, the space information system, which is made up of
reconnaissance satellites, communications satellites, navigational satellites, weather satellites, and geodetic
satellites as well as earth-based systems, can provide information support at real-time speeds for the land, sea, and
air battlefields of space operations, thus meeting the requirements for real-time actions in space operations.

In addition, microelectronic technology, computer technology, and precision guidance technology are used in space
equipment, and they are particularly used in new-concept weapons, promoting a great degree of digitization in weapons
guidance systems and further improving the precision of attack in space operations weapons. Success in the research and
development of land-based, sea-based, and airborne anti-missile and antispaceship weapons, as well as space weapons and
equipment like space-based directed energy and kinetic energy weapons, and putting these into use, has provided a number
of precise and highly effective means of firepower attack for future space operations. In the area of anti-missile and
anti-spaceship operations, land-based, sea-based, airborne, and space-based anti-missile and anti-spaceship weapons can
precisely intercept the opponent’s ballistic missiles and various kinds of orbiting spaceships that operate in outer
space, by means of direct collisions or fragmentation. Experience in operations shows that the effectiveness of attacks
by space-based high-energy laser weapons against satellites and ballistic missiles is extremely clear. In the areas of
attack operations from space against the earth, orbiting bombs moving in earth orbit in peacetime can quickly leave
orbit and reenter the atmosphere to attack ground targets in wartime just as soon as they receive an operational
command, by relying upon reverse-thrust rockets. Some orbiting bomb weapons are stockpiled on the ground in peacetime,
and are launched into orbit in wartime, based on operational requirements; after entering the target area, they use
reverse thrust rockets to reenter the atmosphere to attack their targets. Space-based directed energy and kinetic energy
weapons, like lasers, microwaves, particle beams, and kinetic energy interceptor missiles, can carry out precise and
very strong attacks from outer space against various land, sea, air, and space targets, and can quickly change their
targets of attack.

# V. Support missions are arduous...36

Space operations are high-tech operations where there is a great deal of investment and a great deal of consumption. The
two combatants emphasize attacks against their opponent’s space operations systems, and the complexity and fragility of
space operations systems themselves have determined that the task of support for space operations will be quite arduous
and onerous.

On the one hand, technical support for space operations is complex. Because the construction of space equipment is
extraordinarily strict and complex, its technical nature is strong, the rhythm of operational actions is rapid, and the
rate of battle damage is fairly large, along with the special nature of the space battlefield, these [all] make
technical support extremely difficult. First, space equipment is complicated and it is quite systemic in nature, so the
task of technical support is heavy. Space strengths are operational strengths in which technology is concentrated, so
technical support for them involves

extremely broad areas. Second, the rhythm of operational actions is rapid, so technical support is very difficult.
Future space operations will be very sudden, the time will be quite short, and there will be large amounts of technical
equipment and many models, with heavy technical requirements and urgent deadlines for completion; thus support will be
very difficult. Third, there will be heavy battle damage in space operations, and the task of repair will be arduous. In
future space operations, because of precision guidance technology, information confrontation technology, and widespread
use of new-concept weapons technology, and because combat methods such as long-range assaults and precision assaults
will be fully developed, the rate of battle damage to weapons and equipment will be great, and the task of emergency
combat repairs will be correspondingly arduous. Fourth, the special nature of the space environment will complicate
technological support conditions. Two forms of maintenance will usually be used for space equipment that has been
damaged: maintenance in orbit and maintenance on the ground. As regards repairs in orbit, it will be necessary to
establish technological support strengths that are extremely mobile and that can enter space at any time and carry out
concomitant support for space equipment; as regards ground maintenance, it will be necessary to adopt various measures
to return the damaged equipment safely, before it is possible to repair it.

On the other hand, there will be a huge consumption of operational materiel. In future space operations, there will be
enormous consumption of ammunition, fuel, weapons and equipment, and articles for daily use. The confrontations between
the two hostile sides will be extraordinarily intense, and this will require that the space strengths carry out
continuous and high-intensity mobile operations. This inevitably will lead to an increase in the amount of energy and
fuel and weapons and ammunition that is consumed; as the accuracy of hits and the destructive power of space weapons
systems continually grow, this will continually increase the rate of battle damage to space strengths; because the space
battlefield will be in a situation where there is a high vacuum, microgravity, and strong radiation, this will require
providing personnel who directly enter space to engage in operations with large amounts of daily supplies in order to
maintain their existence. At the same time, the large amounts of operational materiel that is consumed will greatly
increase the payloads for space transportation. In future space operations, the key to whether operational materiel can
be carried into space in a steady stream, to whether damaged weapons and equipment and operations personnel can return
to the surface in a timely manner, and to whether space strengths can carry out rapid movement, lies in space
transportation. The great rapidity of space operations actions and the heavy consumption of operational materiel mean
that space transportation will have to be characterized by having rapid reaction, by being large in scale, and by being
low-cost, before it can meet the needs of future space operations.

# VI. It will be greatly affected by the natural environment...37

The natural environment of space operations refers to the natural environment in which space operations activities
exist. Space operations actions involve the land, sea, air, space, and electronic battlefields, and the omni-dimensional
nature of battlefield spaces has determined the complex special nature of its natural environment. Space operations will
include offensive and defensive actions in outer space as well as offensive and defensive actions between outer space
[on the one hand] and the air, ground, and sea [on the other]. The factors of the outer space, atmospheric, land, and
sea natural environments will unavoidably affect space operations actions to differing extents.

The atmospheric natural environment has a major impact on the deployment of space strengths, on gathering and
transmitting space information, and on projections by weapons. First, it is easy for the launching and recovery of
spacecraft to be affected and restricted by the atmospheric environment. The atmospheric environment factor in the areas
where space launch sites are located has a very great role in affecting and restricting space launch activities. The
explosion of the United States’ space shuttle Challenger was primarily caused by atmospheric environmental factors (low
temperatures). Second, the upward and downward transmission of space monitoring and control and of space remote sensing
information must go through atmospheric spaces, and when electromagnetic waves are transmitted through atmospheric
spaces, they are restrained by “atmospheric windows,” which results in atmospheric attenuation. Third, weapons
projections in space operations must pass through the atmosphere. When carrying out anti-missile, antispacecraft, and
space-to-earth attack operations, projections from directed energy and kinetic energy weapons must pass through the
atmosphere, and they will be affected quite a bit by the atmospheric environment. For example, when lasers, microwaves,
and particle beams are disseminated through atmospheric spaces, they will lose part of their energy because of
atmospheric attenuation, and when kinetic energy interception shells and electromagnetic cannon shells fly through
atmospheric spaces, such environmental factors as wind and air resistance will have a fairly large impact on the
distance of their operations and the precision of their attacks. Land and sea natural environments will directly affect
the efficiency of space operations. The visible light imaging reconnaissance equipment of photoreconnaissance satellites
cannot play their role under conditions where there is the dark of night, and it is not easy for infrared imaging
reconnaissance equipment to find targets that are merged into the environmental background; moreover, they cannot find
targets hidden in underground fortifications. Maritime surveillance satellites’ ability to reconnoiter and monitor
surface ships is somewhat decreased under complex weather and sea conditions, and it is fairly hard for [these
satellites] to detect submarines sailing underwater. It is hard for space-based laser weapons to attack underground and
underwater targets, and the attack accuracy of kinetic energy weapons is affected quite a bit by weather factors above
the land and above the sea.

# VII. There are many restraining factors in the international community...38

Outer space has become a high ground that each space power in the world is struggling for, and it is now becoming the
main battlefield for carrying out space operations missions. As the various countries in the world continually explore
and use outer space, and with the development of space technology, there is an ever-greater number of international
factors restraining military actions in outer space, and these have a comprehensive effect on space operations.

On the one hand, outer space law and bilateral or multilateral international space conventions and agreements restrict
space operations actions. Outer space law comes under international law, and it regulates relations among the various
countries of the world in outer space activities and stipulates the legal status of outer space and the principles,
stipulations, and rules and regulations that the various countries should abide by as they engage in space exploration
and as they exploit and use [space] resources. In 1958, the UN established the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space (abbreviated as the “Outer Space Committee”), under which were set up two subcommittees, the Legal [Subcommittee]
and the Scientific and Technical [Subcommittee], which were separately responsible for deliberating on and researching
the legal issues related to outer space. Since the 1960s, the UN has drafted a series of principles and stipulations for
outer space activities, such as the Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the
Exploration and Use of Outer Space; the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and
Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies; and the Convention on Registration of Objects
Launched into Outer Space. These international rules have a certain active role in ensuring that the various nations’
space activities are conducted in an orderly manner, and they have a certain restrictive role for future space
operations. In future space operations, it is necessary to be good at using outer space law, which is a weapon of law.
For this reason, it is necessary to strengthen our awareness of outer space law and to comprehensively understand and
master the relevant language of outer space law, and it is necessary to actively participate in the drafting of outer
space law and to strive to draft laws that will benefit ourselves and will not benefit the enemy.

On the other hand, bilateral or multilateral international space conventions and agreements also are important factors
that restrain future space operations. Combined military-civilian [missions] and international cooperation have become
one of the important trends in the development of the world’s space enterprises. The sphere and details of international
space cooperation are extremely broad; there is not only civilian space cooperation, but there is also military space
cooperation, and there is not only economic and technological cooperation, but there is also political cooperation. The
International Space Station that sixteen countries, including the United States, Western Europe, Russia, and Japan, have
joined to construct comes under economic and technological cooperation, whereas the military satellite system that the
United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries jointly operated in the Gulf War and the Kosovo Campaign
comes under military cooperation. By following the path of international cooperation in order to develop your own space
strengths, and through signing bilateral or multilateral international space conventions and agreements, it is not only
possible to quickly strengthen your own space military power, but it is also possible to restrain to a certain extent
your opponent’s actions for attacking your own spacecraft. Therefore, it is necessary to get a correct grasp on trends
in international space cooperation, to pay close attention to trends in the international cooperation that major hostile
nations engage in within the sphere of space, to actively launch “space diplomacy,” and to constantly expand the scope
of cooperation with friendly countries in the sphere of space, so as to create a favorable international political,
diplomatic, and military environment for carrying out space operations in the future.

# Section 2: Guiding Thought for Space Operations...39

Guiding thought for space operations is the core guiding viewpoints that are proposed based on a conscientious and
comprehensive summary of the characteristics and laws of space operations and that have the nature of orientation, of
guidance, and of the overall situation; they manifest in a concentrated manner strategic thinking for organizing space
operations; they are the basic foundation for planning and carrying out space operations; and they are the overall
requirements that are proposed for the various strengths that participate in space operations. The level at which space
operations [operate] is high, and small campaign and tactical actions could be related to major strategic issues.
Therefore, the guiding thought for space operations must have the military strategic guidelines as its basis, [it must]
have the world’s strategic setup and the situation of military development as its background, [it must] have the overall
situation of preparations for military combat as the focus of its planning, [it must] keep an eye on major strategic
opponents and the realities of the world’s military combats, and it must suit the characteristics and laws of space
operations; at the same time, it also must take into consideration the reaction that the international community may
have to space operations actions.

Under the premise of corresponding to these requirements, studying and establishing guiding thought for space operations
also requires giving full consideration to your own country’s developmental requirements in preparing for future
military combat; in

accordance with the characteristics and requirements of space operations strengths, and [it requires] adapting to the
existing levels and future developmental trends of space technology, focusing on the characteristics of the battlefield
environment of space operations and on possible changes, adapting to actual combat capabilities and the state of space
operations weapons and equipment, and comprehensively and systematically summarizing the experiences of space operations
that have already occurred in the world. Based on these myriad actual requirements, space operations in future wars
should abide by the basic guiding thought of “active defense, full-spectrum integration, and a focus on control of
space.”

# I. Basic connotations...40

Active defense refers to the thinking of preemption as regards strategy and of taking the initiative to defeat the enemy
as regards campaigns and combat, and of planning for and guiding the overall situation of space operations. The nature
of the guiding thought of “active defense” in space operations is “defense,” while the essence is “active.” Defense
refers to the defensive position of space operations as regards strategy, as well as to taking a self-defense position
strategically and establishing a space operations posture that resists aggression, that protects the nation’s security,
and that defends your own interests; its goal is to maintain the initiative politically and diplomatically. Active
refers to focusing on preparations for space operations and on space offensive actions as regards campaigns and combats,
and to achieving the goals of strategic defense through campaigns and combats. This is manifested as an organic
combination of defense as regards strategy and of attack as regards campaigns and tactics. That is, space operations
overall are defensive, but in specifics, space operations actions are not confined to defense; instead, active space
offensive actions are adopted during the process of strategic defense.

Full-spectrum integration refers to the integrated joint operations of the various services and service arms that
integrate space offense and defense, that integrate space information support and firepower attack actions, and that
integrate means of space hard kill and soft kill, within the spaces of all the dimensions of land, sea, air, space, and
electronics, and centered on the goals of space operations; [this is done ] through fusing command information systems
with the various key factors of operations that are related to space operations, such as reconnaissance and early
warning, command and control, communications, and weapons and equipment. The guiding thought in space operations of
“full-spectrum integration” in essence is joint operations of an integrated nature in which the various services and
service arms jointly participate within all dimensions of space; the main way to do this is to rely upon the command
information system merging each of the various key factors in operations, while the mechanism for victory is

comprehensive superiority that takes shape by forming space information superiority, firepower superiority, and actions
superiority.

A focus on control of space refers to the overall use of various strengths and means for space operations, and primarily
for seizing command of space. The focus is on jamming, blocking, damaging, and destroying key targets in the enemy’s
space operations system; on damaging the enemy’s system of space operations; and on greatly weakening the enemy’s
ability to control space. The essence of the guiding thought of “focus on control of space” in space operations is
“controlling space,” and the core is “control of space in a focused manner.” “Focus on controlling space” primarily
stresses clarifying that the ultimate objective is seizing command of space, through damaging the enemy’s space
operations systems and greatly weakening the enemy’s ability to control space. “Focus on controlling space” primarily
includes such operational actions as space deterrence, space information support, space-to-space attacks,
space-to-ground attacks, and ground-tospace attacks.

The three aspects of guiding thought for space operations are a closely connected organic whole. “Active defense” is the
basic requirement for space operations, and it clarifies the nature of space operations; “full-spectrum integration” is
the organizational form of space operations, and it clarifies the mechanism for victory in space operations and the
basic means [for victory]; and “focus on control of space” is the ultimate goal of space operations, and it clarifies
the core tasks and basic combat methods for space operations.

# II. The basis for establishment...41

The guiding thought for space operations, as a rational understanding of the characteristics and laws of space
operations under certain historical conditions, should have a scientific theoretical basis and a firm practical
foundation. The guiding thought of “active defense, full-spectrum integration, and a focus on control of space” is
proposed [based on] objective realities such as having the military strategic guidelines as the outline, combining the
characteristics of space operations, focusing on the current state and possible developments of space strengths, and the
conditions of the main strategic opponent.

1. The thought of military theoreticians is the theoretical source of “active defense”

The $1 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } } .$ century Prussian military theoretician [Carl von] Clausewitz elaborated on the thought
of active defense, at the tactical level, and he proposed that active defense “is defense whose goals are passive but
whose means are active,” and that “it is a shield composed of clever attacks.” The Swiss military theoretician of the
same period,

[Antoine-Henri] Jomini, pointed out that active defense “is defense that needs to carry out surprise attacks.” [Karl]
Marx carried out a revolutionary transformation and development of these viewpoints, and believed that “Defensive
warfare by no means excludes offensive actions that ‘the process of events in warfare’ requires being taken;”
[Friedrich] Engels pointed out that “Effective defense still is active defense that is accomplished through offensive;”
and [Vladimir] Lenin pointed out that “In addition to mastering the offensive, it is also necessary to master the proper
retreat.” Mao Zedong pointed out that “Active defense is also called offensive defense and is also called defense that
is a decisive battle” and that “It is defense [that is done] for counterattacks and for offensives.” These important
ideological discourses regarding active defense provide a theoretical source for the guiding thought of space
operations, and they give vitality and vigor to the thinking in space operations of active defense, thus enriching the
scientific connotations of space offensive operations and space defensive operations.

2. Space strategy has determined the defensive nature of space operations

Space strategy is planning and guidance done by a country or an alliance of countries for the sphere of outer space,
which is overall in nature, in such aspects as politics, economics, science and technology, and the military It is an
outer space political, economic, science and technology, and military program by a nation or alliance of nations within
a certain historical period, and it has a long-term, comprehensive, and profound impact on the development and military
struggle of space strengths. In the area of space strategy, the world has always advocated the peaceful use of outer
space, opposed militarization of outer space, and prevented an arms race in outer space. Although the United States has
ignored opposition from the international community and held to policies that deploy missile defense systems in order to
control space, thus forming a comprehensive space threat against the various countries of the world, still, peace-loving
countries have all consistently pursued a defensive-type space strategy that suits their own national situations and
military situations, and have strongly opposed the United States’ policies for militarizing space. In order to break the
United States’ monopoly on outer space, the various countries have actively and steadily promoted development of outer
space strategies, and have treated active defense as the basic guide in developing their construction of outer space.
Space operations strengths are an operational strength that is strategic in nature, and their use affects the entire
situation. The United States and other military powers stress that an attack by any nation against their space systems
is equivalent to launching a nuclear war. Based on these circumstances, when using space strengths, it will be necessary
to stand at the vantage point of strategy and to comprehensively consider the various political, diplomatic, economic,
and military factors, in order to make decisions cautiously and to strive not to “fire the first shot” at the strategic
level. This kind of outer space strategy has determined that space operations will be defensive in nature.

3. The characteristics of the use and actions of space operations strengths have determined that they will be
“full-spectrum integration”

The scope of the battlefield spaces of future space operations will cover the spaces of all the dimensions of land, sea,
air, space, and electronics, and their operational actions will unfold in an integrated manner in the spaces of all
these dimensions, so they will be fullspectrum integrated actions for joint operations. Space operations not only stress
the integrated use of military with civilian and commercial spaces, but they also stress approaches where the use of
space operations strengths is integrated with land, sea, and air operations strengths; [where there is] compatibility of
science and technology; [where there is] heavy reliance by high-tech warfare on space information systems; and [where
there is] an expansion of the use of civilian and commercial space strengths to participate in and support space
operations. Because the number and scale of military space strengths are limited, and the development of civilian and
commercial space strengths is quite rapid, therefore, only by adopting necessary measures is it possible to have these
meet the needs of space operations. In future space operations, some civilian and commercial space strengths will become
an important auxiliary strength. On the other hand, the integrated launch of space operations actions with other
operational actions in the spaces of all dimensions has the typical characteristics of integrated joint operations’
actions. Space operations actions require that other operational actions cooperate with them to carry out operational
tasks, and other operational tasks are inseparable from the support and cooperation of space operations actions. Space
operations actions will be important actions in future space operations actions, and they will primarily involve
collecting, transmitting, and processing space information and [involve] using space weapons against enemy space, air,
sea, and land targets as they carry out attack missions. And in order to ensure that space operations are smoothly
carried out, it will be necessary for land, sea, air, and other operational strengths to coordinate with space
operations actions in destroying and damaging the surface installations of the enemy’s space operations systems; in
jamming, deceiving, and suppressing the enemy’s space-surface data links; and in protecting the surface installations of
your own space operations systems. Therefore, “full-spectrum integration” is something that is determined by the
characteristics of the use and actions of space operations strengths.

4. The development of command information systems has laid a material foundation for “full-spectrum integration”

The possible developments of command information systems will lay an important material foundation for merging with the
various key factors of operations that are related to space operations, such as reconnaissance and early warning,
command and control, communications, and weapons and equipment, in order to carry out integrated joint operations of the
various services and service arms that integrate space offense and defense, that integrate space information support
with firepower attack actions, and that integrate means of space hard kills and soft kills. By relying on the
networkization of space information links and on making space attack platforms intelligent, space information systems
and space weapons systems will become important nodes in the reconnaissance intelligence and monitoring systems and
attack systems within the operations system, and they will be further merged with command and control systems and with
computer network systems, thus forming a command information system whose functions are more complete. Given the
“multiplier” effect of space information systems, as the functions of command information systems are continually
improved, they will form informationized operations systems that integrate the functions of command and control,
communications, intelligence, monitoring, reconnaissance, and attack; they will strengthen the merging of space
operations strengths with the operations functions of other services and service arms; and they will thus be able to
meet the needs of space operations for full-spectrum integrated operations that are large in scope and greatly indepth.
In military practices, the United States has already researched and developed a global command and control system
(GCCS), and has fully put it to use in operations. GCCS is a dispersed-style computer network that supports the United
States’ global joint operations; it closely integrates the four dimensions of land, sea, air, and space into one, and it
has the functions of command and control over space information support and space offensive and defense operations
actions. This system’s lowest-level users include joint expeditionary units and the joint expeditionary units’ elements
and soldiers; its intermediate-level users are theater of war commands and services’ units; and its highestlevel users
are the nation’s command authorities, the national military command centers, and the services’ headquarters. After this
system was launched, it could ensure that there was smooth and unhindered exchanges of various types of aerospace
information and data between the various services and service arms [on the one hand] and the commands [on the other],
thus bringing into play the important core role for the US military as it carried out integrated space operations. It
can be seen from this that the command information system has the possibility of developing and of laying a material
foundation for full-spectrum integrated space operations.

5. Command of space is the premise for space strengths to carry out operational missions

In joint operations, providing space information assistance and support and carrying out offensive and defensive
operations are important operational tasks for space strengths. Speaking of space operations strengths themselves, if
they want to complete joint operations missions and achieve the goals of space operations, they must have command of
space as a necessary condition and important premise. On the one hand, command of space is a necessary condition for
space strengths to effectively provide information assistance and support. The reason is that space strengths’ prominent
advantages in getting information mean that the various operational actions that land, sea, and air operational
strengths engage in during future informationized warfare will rely more and more upon the operational information
support that is provided by the systems for getting and transmitting space information. This is primarily displayed as:
the use of reconnaissance satellites makes it possible to collect the enemy’s military intelligence in a comprehensive
and accurate manner and in real-time, so that commanders can promptly get a grip on the enemy’s deployments and his
firepower distribution, and thus take corresponding measures in a focused manner; the use of communications satellites
makes it possible to achieve global and continuous communications in all weathers, and its encryption is strong and it
is highly reliable, so that commanders can carry out flexible and effective command and control over their units; and
the use of navigation and positioning satellites not only makes it possible to allow your own units to carry out rapid
and accurate movement, but also makes it possible to enhance the aiming precision of operations weapons, so as to carry
out precision attacks against the enemy. Therefore, it will be necessary to do everything you can to seize and hold
space dominance throughout the entire process of future warfare and to prevent the enemy from threatening your own space
information systems, so as to ensure that your own space communications systems effectively carry out the operational
task of information support. On the other hand, command of space is an important premise by which space strengths carry
out effective offensive and defensive operations. The reason is that the high speed of spacecraft operation and the
international nature and connectedness of space itself allow space strengths to quickly arrive at any region in space
and to attack any region or target on the earth’s surface. Moreover, space weapons have the characteristics where their
launches are fast, their accuracy is high, and their power is great, so that space strengths can quickly and accurately
destroy important political, economic, and military targets within the depths of the enemy’s operations. It can be seen
that space strengths will become important strengths for carrying out offensive and defensive operations in the future.
In future wars, only by having command of space will it be possible to ensure that your own space strengths will not be
affected by attacks by the enemy’s space strengths and resistance by the enemy’s surface space defense systems, or will
suffer few [of these

attacks] in the process of carrying out offensive and defensive operations missions. If you rashly use space strengths
to carry out offensive and defensive operations actions under conditions where you have yet to win command of space, you
will inevitably suffer major losses, and this could lead to loss of the initiative in war. To summarize the above, in
carrying out operational missions, space operations strengths must first have command of space, and the core mission of
space operations is therefore to control space.

6. “Focus on controlling space” is an objective requirement for space power

Space power includes the military, civilian, and commercial space strengths that a nation or alliance of nations
currently have; they are an important material foundation for carrying out space missions; and they restrain the guiding
thought, forms, means, and scale of space operations. Space battlefield strengths’ greatest difference from land, sea,
and air battlefield strengths is that their scale is limited and their costs are high. Even space powers whose economic
strength is strong cannot carry out large-scale space confrontations, but instead treat comprehensive control of space
as their objective in space warfare, and they use their space strengths in a concentrated manner to achieve this
objective. Speaking of space nations, their investments in space are limited, the scale of their space military
strengths is also limited, and even less can they be used on a wide scale. Therefore, focusing on the objective
conditions of space power, it is necessary as regards command of operations to stress limited and effective goals in
space operations. In the struggle for command of space, it is necessary to concentrate elite space strengths and to
carry out focused actions to command space. As regards the effectiveness of operations, do not stress complete
destruction of the enemy’s space operations system, but pay attention to bringing into play [your space strengths’]
“pinpoint” effect at decisive times, in order to cut off the enemy’s space communications connections and damage the
support of the enemy’s space operations systems for his ground operations, which will lead to the enemy partially losing
command of space at certain times.

# III. The main issues that should be mastered in implementing guiding thought for space operations...45

An understanding and knowledge of the guiding thought for space operations is quite important; how to implement it and
carry it out in actual operational practices is even more important. Centered on implementing the guiding thought for
space operations, which is core, it is necessary to focus on getting a firm grasp on the following major issues.

1. Be based on the concept of taking the lead in bringing into play space operations actions

It is necessary to establish the guiding thought for space operations of “active defense, full-spectrum integration, and
a focus on controlling space,” in order to adapt to the new situation and new missions in space operations, and these
are a result of innovations in the theory of outer space militarization. In implementing and using this guiding thought,
it is necessary to be based on new concepts, to continually deepen your understanding of the important position and role
of space operations, and to constantly strengthen your grasp on the characteristics of space operations. In the
transitional period of the world’s military development, new models of outer space weapons and equipment are being
developed fairly rapidly; if thinking and concepts do not develop and are not renovated, but still stay with the
previous model of thinking about space operations, it will then be impossible to leisurely adapt to the huge impact and
profound changes that space operations will bring to modern warfare. Currently, the pressing need is to break the
fetters of outmoded thinking and old concepts, and to be based on the concepts that space operations actions will
initiate prior to other operational actions. The saying goes, arrange for forage and food before troops and horses move
out. In the past there was a stress on “having information in advance” and on “information superiority,” but without
space operations, there is no “information superiority;” space operations are a concrete form for manifesting
“information in advance” and are the basic condition for seizing “information superiority.” Thus, space operations have
already become the “forerunner” for modern local wars. In the advance preparations stage for operations involving a
powerful enemy, the powerful enemy inevitably will first organize movements by his space operations strengths and carry
out very powerful and continuous actions by his space information reconnaissance; space information reconnaissance
actions of this scale and intensity differ from those of peacetime, and the enemy will begin to carry out his preemptive
strategy. Strictly speaking, he will have already fired the “first shot” in space operations, and strategically, we
should actively organize space defenses, engage in striking back, and struggle to take the initiative to defeat the
enemy at the campaign and combat levels in space operations.

2. Comprehensively adopt multiple forms of operations

Actual warfare and deterrence are the two major forms of operations in space operations, they are an important form for
manifesting the thought of “active defense,” and they must be used in the practices of space operations in an integrated
form. Just as with nuclear strengths, space military strengths have the role of strategic deterrence. But where they
differ from nuclear strengths is that the threshold for using space strategic strengths is much lower than that for
nuclear strengths. Speaking in this sense, the use of space

strategic strengths not only needs to focus on deterrence, but it also needs to keep an eye on actual combat and to do a
good job of handling the relationship between deterrence and actual warfare. When handling the relationship between
these two, it is necessary to pay attention to differentiating between the “possession” of deterrence and the “use” of
actual warfare. Some space weapons are similar to nuclear weapons; they have a strategic deterrence role, but they
cannot be lightly used. Although the possibility that these space weapons will be used in actual warfare is not great,
their value as strategic deterrence is quite big, and by bringing into play the benefits of their deterrence it is often
possible to get the effects of “subduing the enemy without fighting.” However, deterrence is not bluster; if you want to
truly get the effects of deterrence, it is necessary to have a certain ability for actual warfare and to make solid
preparations for actual warfare. Prior to a war breaking out, it is possible, by displaying necessary space strategic
strengths that have deterrence as their goal, to restrain the outbreak of the war. At the start of the war’s outbreak,
it is possible to restrain the escalation of the war through space actions that are deterrent in nature, in an attempt
to resolve the crisis under conditions that are favorable to yourself, and to end the war’s conflict. During the process
of the war, once it is necessary, you should firmly and resolutely use space operations strengths in order to retaliate
and to actively create an operational situation that is favorable to yourself.

3. Pay attention to bringing into play the effectiveness of integrated operations

To ultimately implement the thinking in space operations of “full-spectrum integration,” it is necessary to rely upon
effectively bringing into play the overall effectiveness of the full-spectrum battlefield, the various strengths, the
various means of operations, and the operational actions in space operations. To do this, you should earnestly do a
thorough job of combining the following four aspects. The first is to combine specialized strengths with non-specialized
strengths. The specialized strengths in space operations are the main body in space operations, which is responsible for
major operational tasks and which bring the major effects into play. In addition to this, the non-specialized strengths
in space operations are also an indispensably important component part in the overall strengths in space operations. The
two each have their superiorities, and they should be organically combined in order to defeat the enemy as a whole. The
second is to combine military strengths with local strengths. Space operations require energetic support and active
participation by space personnel. This special field of operations provides a broad battlefield for local space and
information strengths to participate in and to bring their roles into play. Space operations should fully utilize the
rich local resources of talented personnel, technology, and installations, in order to carry out integrated operations
by the various military and local strengths involved in space operations, within the differing spheres of space
operations. The third is to combine space operations actions with other operational actions. Space operations are
closely related to other operational actions; they are an organic whole. To combine space operations actions with other
operational actions, it is necessary to be skilled at using the effects of other operational actions at the same time
that you actively bring into play the effects of space operations actions themselves, in order to achieve the goals of
space operations. The fourth is to combine the tangible battlefield with the intangible battlefield. Space operations,
where networks and electronics predominate, are primarily carried out on intangible battlefields like network spaces and
the sphere of the electromagnetic spectrum, and they differ greatly from the firepower confrontations on the
traditional, tangible battlefield. Combining the tangible battlefield with the intangible battlefield requires merging
cyber warfare, electronic warfare, and psychological operations, with firepower warfare and special operations,
coordinating these in attacking the enemy and preserving themselves.

4. Be flexible in using means of operations

The integrated use of means of space operations is an important detail in the operational thinking of “full-spectrum
integration and with a focus on controlling space;” it is also an effective means for weakening and disrupting the
enemy’s space operations capabilities and for seizing command of space. In the practices of operations, it is necessary
to be skilled at flexibly using means of soft kills and of hard kills. The reason is that the various means of space
operations each have their limitations, and thus it is necessary to flexibly use the two means of operations – “soft”
and “hard” – based on the nature of the predetermined objective of operations and on the expected level of damage. On
the one hand, soft kills are a single operational action, as well as an important support for carrying out hard kills.
Only through coordination with soft kills is it possible to smoothly carry out hard kills; otherwise it will be quite
difficult for it to succeed. On the other hand, soft kills have no way to get the effects of direct destruction and
killing against the enemy’s space-based operational platforms and surface bases and personnel. Hard kills can supplement
the insufficiencies of the means of soft kills, and the results of their destruction and kills can have a long-term
impact on the enemy’s abilities for space operations, as well as make it easier to further organize soft-kill actions.
However, it generally is not easy to take the lead in using the means of hard kills in space operations prior to the
enemy using space hard-kill weapons or while your own side is still trapped in a situation where it is totally on the
defensive in space operations in campaigns. But it is easy for means of soft kills in space operations to achieve
surprise and concealment in space campaigns, and we should focus more on using them flexibly. The use of the means of
soft kills, such as electromagnetic attacks, network attacks, and low-energy lasers, can paralyze or weaken the enemy’s
abilities for space systems operations, and can achieve the killing effects needed in operations without producing other
collateral damage. Means of soft kills in space operations often are relatively sudden; they are not easy to discover,
and it is hard to trace their source, so that it is possible to conceal

operational intentions fairly well. They are an important means for seizing command of space.

5. Be cautious in using space hard-kill weapons

Outer space is shared by all mankind; the military, civilian, and commercial spacecraft of the various countries operate
in differing orbits, forming an outer space battlefield situation in which the enemy, we, and friends are interwoven.
This makes the international environment of space operations more complex than on other battlefields. Against this
background, the use of hard-kill weapons to attack enemy space operations platforms would easily affect the normal
operations of neutral parties’ spacecraft or even cause “accidental damage;” attacking enemy space support installations
that are located in third countries could also drag the third countries into the war, thus trapping [us] in putting us
on the defense strategically and diplomatically. With the rapid increase in the number of outer space spacecraft, the
continual shrinking of the relative spaces of the outer space battlefield will directly affect the placement and orbital
maneuvering of outer space troop strengths and weapons; with the increase in density of spacecraft within the same scope
of space, it will be more difficult to identify, monitor, and control targets on the outer space battlefield. These real
problems will affect accuracy and precision in the use of hard-kill weapons; if there is an error in judgment, a tiny
error in use will produce a serious strategic mistake. In addition, the destruction of land-based space operations
targets will lead to an expansion in the scope of the war, and an attack on the enemy’s homeland usually will be viewed
as a move to escalate the war. In particular, as soon as an attack produces fragments in outer space, this will endanger
all satellites in orbit, and will thus trigger diplomatic disputes. Moreover, the outer space fragments could also
endanger your own country’s satellite system. Therefore, it is necessary, focused on actual military actions against
opponents in operations, to be cautious in using space hard-kill weapons.

# Section 3: The Basic Principles of Space Operations...48

The basic principles of space operations are basic criteria that manifest the characteristics and laws of space
operations and that guide space operations actions. In guiding the launch of space operations, you should firmly hold to
the basic principles of “being fully prepared and carefully deploying; clarifying missions and unifying command;
integrating joint actions and integrating offense and defense; being precise in selecting key points and the nodes for
attack; having a grasp on opportunities for battle, and being concealed and sudden; and having mechanisms be smooth,
with close coordination.”

# I. Being fully prepared and carefully deploying...49

Being fully prepared and carefully deploying refers to having a comprehensive and focused grasp of the enemy situation
during the preparatory stage on the verge of war, based on the operational intentions of the commander, the space
operations mission, and the task organization of the space operations strengths, and to carrying out overall operations
research and careful planning, taking things into overall consideration, and making overall plans and arrangements for
the various kinds of strengths in space operations and the various actions in space operations. In future space
operations, conditions will be complex and changing, there will be a great deal of surprise and destructiveness, and
weapons will be very complicated; it will be even more necessary to conscientiously and carefully engage in organization
and preparations, in order to lay a firm foundation for winning in space operations. To carry out the operational
principle of “being fully prepared and carefully deploying,” you should comprehensively utilize the various means of
information reconnaissance, have a comprehensive and focused grasp of relevant situations in enemy space operations,
continually monitor actions by the enemy space operations strengths, and analyze and predict the intentions, objectives,
forms, scale, and main directions of operation in enemy space operations, as well as the weapons and equipment that he
could use and the tactical and technical measures that he could take. [You should] emphatically clarify the goals of our
space operations, our important objectives, our basic combat methods, and our deployments for operations. [You should]
carry out scientific allocation and combinations of space strengths, so as to form a system of space operations
strengths where they are deployed correctly, linked together, and laid out rationally. [You should] correctly determine
the objectives, occasions, areas of space, and frequency domains for space operations, and carefully draft plans for
space operations. [Finally, you should] carefully organize support, based on the characteristics of space operations.

# II. Clarifying missions and unifying command...49

Clarifying missions and unifying command refers to executing integrated command over the various combatant services and
service arms and the ground space operations strengths, under the premise of clarifying the missions of operations.
Space operational strengths are classified as strategic strengths; their structure is diverse and their deployment is
dispersed, the methods and means of space operations are diverse, the effectiveness of space operations can cover all
dimensions of space and a broad scope, space operations actions are closely combined with other operational actions, and
the success or failure of space operations often directly affects the overall war situation. Therefore, only by
clarifying the operational missions of the various combatant strengths and carrying out highly centralized and unified
command is it possible to ensure that the various strengths in space operations act in a coordinated manner and to bring
into play the maximum effectiveness of operations. In carrying out the operational principle of “clarifying missions and
unifying command,” it is necessary to use the guiding thought of space operations to unify the actions of the various
space operations strengths, so that each space operations action is closely centered on the goals and missions of space
operations as it is carried out. You should establish an integrated space operations command organization, clarify
command relations and command jurisdictions, organize and use space operations strengths in a unified manner, and plan
in a unified manner the actions of subordinate space operations strengths, based on the needs of space operations and in
accordance with the need to be authoritative, highly capable, agile, and highly effective. Relying on the command
information system, [you should] improve the space operations command network, in order to ensure that operational
command is unimpeded and highly effective. [Finally, you should] flexibly adopt forms of command based on the
battlefield situation.

# III. Integrating joint actions and integrating offense and defense...50

Integrating joint actions and integrating offense and defense refer to the merging of mobility, firepower, defense
capabilities, and information capabilities by the various kinds of operational strengths related to space operations,
through a common understanding of full-spectrum spaces and synchronized planning, so that space offensive and defensive
operational actions are seamless, form a system, and are coordinated. By comprehensively and rigorously forming a space
defense, it is possible to reduce the effectiveness of enemy space attacks and to support your own side’s effective use
of space, and it is possible to facilitate the smooth execution of space offensive actions; this is an important
condition for transforming being on the defensive into being on the attack. However, space defense has no way to
basically weaken an enemy’s space strengths, whereas an effective space offensive can damage and destroy the enemy’s
space strengths and lower his ability to use space. Space offense can strengthen space defense and correspondingly [can]
strengthen your own side’s ability for space defense and [can] support regularly bringing the effectiveness of your own
side’s space strengths into play. Space offense and space defense are two inseparable and important component parts in
space operations; lopsidedly stressing either one while ignoring the other is unacceptable. At the same time that the
two are used together, it should be stressed even more that only through unified space operations planning and by
relying upon the merged functions of command information systems and the characteristics that space operations platforms
have of being intelligent, is it possible to make space offensive and defensive operations actions seamless and
coordinated, and to achieve “integrated joint actions and integrated offense and defense” in the true sense of the term.
Therefore, “integrating joint actions and integrating offense and defense” are critical to the success of space
operations and are an important principle in space operations. In implementing the operational principle of “integrating
joint actions and integrating offense and defense,” space operations offensive and defensive actions in differing
dimensional spaces or operational directions must be closely coordinated, and the various operational strengths should
take the initiative to coordinate and integrate their joint actions; the transformation of space operations offensive
and defensive actions in the same dimensional space or operational direction or operation must be fast and the space for
actions be kept in tight conjunction, so as to not give the enemy a gap that he can take advantage of, to seamlessly
connect the transformation between offense and defense, and to thus quickly and effectively link [the process of] attack
– defend – resume attack in space operations.

# IV. Being precise in selecting key points and the nodes for attack...51

Precision selection of key points and the nodes for attack refers to seizing occasions that favor us, to meticulously
selecting weak links and key nodes in the enemy’s systems of operations, to concentrating and using elite space
operations offensive strengths to carry out an attack, and to thus achieve the goal of damaging the enemy’s system of
operations and weakening the enemy’s overall operational capabilities. Targets in space operations are widely dispersed
over the space battlefield, and it is very hard to carry out attacks one by one against enemy space operations targets,
due to technical and power limitations, so it is quite hard to carry out systemic confrontations with the enemy. In
future operations to seize command of space, you should strive to control the core of operations, to concentrate and use
elite space operations offensive strengths, and to form a superiority over the enemy in a particular time and space,
[and you should] combine tactical and technical means to attack key parts in the enemy’s system of operations, thus
paralyzing the enemy’s system of operations or greatly weakening the operational capabilities of the enemy system.
Therefore, “precision selection of key points and the nodes for attack” is a major combat method in space operations and
is an important principle in space operations. In implementing the operational principle of “precision selection of key
points and the nodes for attack,” you should combine the situations of your space operations strengths, based on the
needs of space operations, and mobilize the important strengths that are capable of carrying out space operations
missions, using them in an integrated manner and strengthening your space operations capabilities. [You should]
concentrate assault operations strengths in major regions (or directions) of operations, major battlefields, major
stages, and crucial seasons, thus forming a local superiority. [You should] meticulously select the enemy’s key and
crucial nodes and his weak links, form a powerful space operations offensive posture, flexibly use means and methods of
soft and hard kills, carry out focused attacks, and thus paralyze, damage, and weaken the functions of the enemy’s
system of operations. [You should] summarize and consider the feasibility and effectiveness of attacks against targets,
on the basis of a comprehensive

grasp of the weak links and crucial nodes in the enemy’s system of operations, and determine the key targets for a
focused attack. [Finally,] you must track in a timely manner and find out about the situation for carrying out a space
operations offensive attack, evaluate the damage effects of an attack, get real-time control, and adjust the various
space operations offensive strengths and their intensity, as the situation warrants.

# V. Having a grasp on opportunities for battle, and being concealed and sudden...51

Having a grasp on opportunities for battle, and being concealed and sudden, refer to the comprehensive use of various
methods and means for concealing the intentions and actions of space operations, for deceiving and confusing the enemy,
for striving to fully master opportunities for operations at a time and place and for objectives that the enemy does not
imagine, and for concentrating space operations offensive strengths in carrying out sudden attacks, thus containing the
enemy within circumstances where he is on the defensive. The features of space operations systems that are easily
attacked are obvious, and having control over opportunities for battle and carrying out concealed and surprise attacks
against [these features] can effectively strengthen your own side’s space operations superiority, leave the enemy on the
defensive, and achieve the effect of a space “blitzkrieg” operation. [These attacks] can speed up development of the
process of space operations and heavy consumption of war potential. [Finally, these attacks] can prevent space
operations actions from continually escalating and worsening, and effectively enhance your ability to control the scope
and intensity of war. Therefore, “having a grasp on opportunities for battle, and being concealed and sudden” is a basic
principle in space operations. In implementing the operational principle of “having a grasp on opportunities for battle,
and being concealed and sudden,” you should be fully prepared for space operations, draft a number of emergency response
scenarios, and thus ensure that you [can] carry out space operations actions at any time. Based on the battlefield
situation, [you should] select and create opportunities for battle, strive to launch attacks at the campaign and
tactical level before the enemy does, and thus ensure that you have the initiative on the space battlefield. [You
should] adopt strict measures for secrecy and strengthen strict management of space information systems and space
operations equipment, thus concealing the intentions of your space operations. [Finally, you should] focus on using such
means as feints in space orbits and deception in space information, and conceal what is real and reveal what is false
about your own side’s space operations intentions, deployments, and actions, so as to achieve the goals of confusing and
out-maneuvering the enemy and of creating errors in the enemy’s judgment and decision-making.

# VI. Having mechanisms be smooth, with close coordination...52

Having mechanisms be smooth, with close coordination, refers to forming mechanisms for smooth coordination among the
various strengths in space operations and between space operations and other operational strengths, in order to carry
out continuous and close coordination and to have the various strengths in space operations always [carry out]
coordinated actions centered on the overall situation of operations. Space operations are both an independent form of
operations as well as an important component part of joint operations, and they often are carried out against a
background of joint operations. But regardless of whether space operations are independently carried out or they are
operational actions against a background of a given type of operations, they do not exist in isolation. They must be
closely coordinated with other operational actions, help each other in their actions, support one another, and have
mechanisms for smooth support; only in this way is it possible to bring into play the integrated combined strength of
space operations strengths and actions and to achieve the goals of space operations. In implementing the operational
principle of “having mechanisms be smooth, with close coordination,” you should establish complete mechanisms for
coordinating space operations strengths with other operational strengths, use many methods of coordination, strengthen
their support for one another, and strive to have this be smooth and continuous. You should rationally differentiate the
missions of the main combat strengths and the support strengths and clarify the relationships for coordination and
support, based on the operational decision and plans and focused on the differing stages of development for space
operations actions. You should organize temporary coordination at appropriate times, strengthen coordination and
support, maintain continuous coordination, and ensure that the various operational actions are coordinated, with an
emphasis on planning and cooperation and based on developments and changes in the space battlefield situation.
[Finally,] you should shorten the time for the transmission, flow, and delay of communications links for space
information between outer space and the atmospheric layer, ensure that coordination of communications is unimpeded, and
thus enhance the battlefield reaction capabilities of the various strengths in space operations.

# Lecture 3 Space Operations Strengths...54

Space operations strengths are operational strengths where space units are the main body, where military space systems
are the backbone, where other space strengths are aids, and which engage in various military actions primarily in outer
space. With the rapid development of space technology by the various countries of the world, the pace at which the
various military powers are struggling for space resources and seeking space superiority has clearly accelerated, the
trend toward militarization of space has become more and more evident, and missions in which space operations strengths
carry out space support and space operations are becoming increasingly frequent, so that their role in future wars will
become ever more important.

# Section 1: The Structure and Characteristics of Space Operations Strengths...54

Space operations strengths primarily consist of space launch and recovery units, space tracking units, spaceflight
combat units, strategic missile units, ground space defense units, and space service support units. Their personnel
mainly consist of command personnel, operations staff, space experts and technical personnel, operations control
personnel, and other ground service and support personnel.

# I. The structure of units of space operations strengths...54

1. Space launch and recovery units

Space launch units refer to units that carry out spacecraft launch missions in order to deliver astronauts, weapons and
equipment, and operations materiel; they generally are constructed on the basis of missile units and satellite launch
units. Space launchings are the primary link and important premise for space strengths to access space and carry out
operational missions, and space launch units’ main work includes testing technical positions, transporting and lifting
[space vehicles], inspecting and testing systems, filling [space vehicles] up with fuel, and carrying out launchings.
After a space launch vehicle (carrier rockets, space shuttles, spaceplanes, and the like) and a spacecraft (such as
satellites, spaceships, and space maneuvering vehicles) approach the site, testing elements immediately carry out
[single] unit tests and composite tests while [the launch vehicle and spacecraft] are in a horizontal position. After
the technical site tests are concluded, transport and lifting elements immediately move the launch vehicle and
spacecraft from the technical site to the launch site, and lift and attach them. After the space launch vehicle and
spacecraft are completely attached, the testing element carries out a subsystems test, a systems match, and an overall
examination. After the launch

site’s testing work is completed, the space base commander should make the decision in a timely manner whether or not to
launch, based on the technical state of the launch vehicle and spacecraft, the conditions of the site equipment, the
state of the tracking system, and weather forecasts. After upper echelons approve of the decision for launch, the
fueling element fuels [the launch vehicle] in accordance with the process of first the fuel and then the oxidant and
first the first stage and then the second stage. After the propellant fueling is complete, the space base headquarters
immediately organizes the launch in accordance with command coordination procedures, and launches the spacecraft to a
predetermined orbit. Under ordinary conditions, the space launch uses the form of a ground fixed or mobile space launch
base, in order to ensure that the space launch, flight, tracking, and support units have relatively ample time to carry
out each task of preparation, so as to improve the chances for the spacecraft’s launch and positioning. Under emergency
conditions, in order to break through an enemy’s space blockade and interception and to rapidly rebuild space strengths,
it is possible to use concentrated launchings on land, at sea, and in the air at many points, in many directions, and in
a short period of time, so as to improve the chances that space launches will break through [the enemy’s] defenses.
Therefore, space launch units must have a certain mobility and the capability for emergency launches.

Space retrieval units refer to units that carry out the missions of searching for and transporting return-type
spacecraft and of ensuring that after astronauts complete their mission, they safely return to the earth base. For
example, after return-type photographic reconnaissance satellites carry out their missions, their film canisters must be
retrieved in a timely manner, in order to get the reconnaissance information as quickly as possible. After manned
spacecraft, like spaceships and space shuttles, complete their missions, it is also necessary for them to quickly return
to the earth base, so as to replace the astronauts, overhaul weapons and equipment, and add propellant.

# 2. Space tracking units

Space tracking units refer to units that carry out the mission of surveying and controlling spacecraft in orbit. Space
tracking units consist of the space control center and certain space tracking stations (including tracking ships and
tracking aircraft) that have equipment for tracking and measuring, remote control, and telemetry. The number,
allocation, and distribution of tracking stations are determined by the flight path of the spacecraft and its need for
tracking. The space control center forms a complex with the various tracking stations, by means of a tracking
communications network; this [complex] is the space tracking network. Space tracking networks can in general be divided
into three types, in accordance with the target being tracked and controlled: satellite tracking networks, which serve
in the launch of various types of applications

satellites and scientific testing satellites; manned space tracking networks, which serve in the launch of manned
spacecraft, and which in addition to having greater requirements for tracking and surveying, telemetry reception, and
remote control devices than the satellite tracking networks, also are equipped with devices for speaking with astronauts
and for transmitting television; and deep space networks, which serve spacecraft that explore the moon and deep-space
planets and which have large-diameter antennas and highly sensitive receiving systems, in order to reach extremely
remote functioning distances.

By means of the space tracking network, the space tracking units first track and survey the flight path of the carrier
rocket and the spacecraft, getting the working and environmental situation of the various subsystems, analyzing the data
that they get, judging the correctness of the spacecraft flight path and the suitability of the spacecraft for the space
environment, and providing a basis for controlling the spacecraft and for improving spacecraft design. Second, they
complete real-time or programmed control, so that the spacecraft reaches its predetermined path and achieves the
necessary attitude; as necessary, they change the spacecraft’s path, flight procedures, and working attitude. Third,
they receive the spacecraft’s special information and recordings, such as some of its exploration data, telemetry
information that reflects the astronauts’ physiological state, and television images, and the space control center
records, displays, and processes this information, and engages in communications contacts with the manned spacecraft’s
crew, thus providing real-time and subsequent analysis for use. Fourth, in regard to applications satellites that
require highly precise positioning (such as navigation satellites, geodetic satellites, and high-resolution
reconnaissance satellites), the satellite position (or path) data and corresponding time data that the tracking network
provides users serves as basic information for applications data processing. Space tracking units must have the ability
for multiple missions and to do real-time tracking.

# 3. Spaceflight combat units

Spaceflight combat units refer to units that carry out various kinds of space operations and relevant assistance and
support missions in space, using space shuttles, spaceplanes, and space stations. The astronauts in spaceflight combat
units have a great deal of subjective initiative and the ability to deal with emergencies, they can make timely and
correct choices and react to urgent or unexpected incidents, and their role is something that is impossible to handle by
relying only upon satellites and other unmanned space weapons. The main methods are first, carrying out space
reconnaissance. By carrying out surveillance or photography in a purposeful manner against ground or sea military
targets or adjustments to enemy deployments, astronauts can clearly improve the effectiveness of reconnaissance and can
analyze materials in a timely manner, thus providing accurate

information for military command. Second is space operations. In space, astronauts can more conveniently intercept,
capture, damage, or jam enemy satellites or space weapons systems. For example, they [can] kill targets by launching
high-energy laser beams, particle beams, or microwave beams; they [can] carry out suppressive or deceptive interference
against enemy spacecraft’s photoelectric reconnaissance and communications equipment, so that these cannot normally
collect information or so that they get false information; and they [can] spread jamming chaff around enemy spacecraft
or spray aerosols or other chemical substances on their exterior, masking or contaminating the enemy spacecraft’s
sensors so that these are temporarily or permanently ineffective. Third is attacks against the earth’s surface. In using
space-based directed energy and kinetic energy weapons to carry out offensive actions from outer space against the
enemy’s important targets on the earth’s surface (to include land, sea, and atmospheric spaces), they have the
characteristics of rapid reaction, global movement, precision attack, and powerful, instantaneous killing and damaging
effects; this is an important symbol of the comprehensive maturing of space operations. Fourth is carrying out
assistance and support for space operations. Examples are carrying out space transportation or trans-atmospheric
transportation, in order to inspect and repair, and fuel other spacecraft, or to test and develop space weapons systems.

# 4. Strategic missile units

Strategic missile units generally refer to strategic ballistic missile units and strategic cruise missile units for
missile launches in the medium range (1,000 kilometers to 5,000 kilometers), long range (5,000 kilometers to 8,000
kilometers) and intercontinental (more than 8,000 kilometers) and above. Strategic ballistic missiles’ main trajectory
is in outer space, and their warheads pass through outer space to reenter the atmosphere and attack targets. Strategic
cruise missiles generally are supersonic cruise missiles that have a flight altitude in near space (more than twenty
kilometers). The ones whose current development is relatively mature are surface-to-surface ballistic missile units.

Ballistic missile units use rockets to deliver their ammunition against enemy targets in order to carry out long-range
attacks; they have two types of operational capabilities: nuclear attack and conventional attack. Examples are the
United States’ Minuteman III strategic ballistic missiles and the Russian Topol-M, RS-24, and Bulava, which have ranges
that can reach 13,000 kilometers. Their characteristics are that units are widely dispersed, their operational actions
are concealed, their preparation time is short, their flight is rapid, they have strong penetration capabilities against
defenses, their destructive power is great, the precision of their operations is gradually being improved, and they can
be used against fixed targets over a huge area, such as political and economic centers, strategic missile bases, and
naval and air force bases. They are an important component part of the system of space operations strengths. Ballistic
missile units normally are composed of missile bases, warhead bases, engineering technology units, and maintenance and
management and other units. Of these, missile bases are responsible for the mission of missile operations, and they
usually have missile launch units, warhead equipment inspection units, and various kinds of operations support units,
with command installations, missile sites, and various types of operations support equipment. Warhead bases are
responsible for the task of storing and supplying warheads, and they have warhead equipment inspection, storage, and
transportation units, with a command organization, repositories, and various support facilities. Engineering technical
units are responsible for such engineering support tasks as setting up missile sites and engineering and installation;
they usually have transportation, engineering technology, and installation departments as well as corresponding stations
and organizations and command organizations. Maintenance and management units are responsible for such tasks as
maintaining and managing various types of equipment and devices and for training personnel; they usually have technical
departments, training departments, and corresponding sites and facilities.

# 5. Ground space defense units

Ground space defense units primarily consist of space early warning and monitoring units and surface-to-space attack
units as well as service and technical support units (or elements); their two main functions are early warning and
attack. Space early warning and monitoring units have strategic early warning and surveillance centers, command and
early warning satellites, and space surveillance long-range radar systems, forming a three-dimensional early warning
network that is responsible for ocean surveillance and missile early warning and for finding and identifying space
targets, tracking enemy spaceship paths, detecting incoming ballistic missiles, providing decision-making support for
the commander to make decisions about counterattacks, and providing other services and service arms and relevant
operational units with early warning information that is needed for operations. After surface-to-space attack units
receive early warning information, they are responsible for carrying out precision positioning of enemy incoming space
weapons, and for suppressing and destroying enemy orbiting spacecraft, weapons in near space, and incoming ballistic
missiles, in order to protect the nation’s important political, economic, and military strategic targets. For example,
the National Missile Defense System (NMD) that the United States developed can intercept longrange ballistic missiles in
the mid-flight stage, and the S-400 Triumf air defense missile weapons system can intercept mid-range ballistic missiles
at ranges of 3,500 kilometers.

The main targets for attacks by ground space defense units are the enemy’s spacecraft in low orbit and incoming
ballistic missiles. The main methods [of attack] are first, the use of land-based, sea-based, and airborne
anti-spacecraft missiles to attack enemy spacecraft, primarily by destroying enemy spacecraft in the form of a
high-speed collision or destroying enemy spacecraft through explosions and fragments. On 13 September 1985, a US Air
Force F-15 [Eagle] fighter launched an anti-satellite missile at an altitude of more than ten kilometers, successfully
destroying a satellite orbiting at more than 500 kilometers. This was mankind’s first use of missiles to destroy a
satellite. Second is the use of land-based, sea-based, and airborne laser weapons to attack enemy spacecraft; not only
is it possible to destroy enemy spacecraft by means of high-powered laser illumination, but it is also possible to
illuminate the enemy spacecraft’s sensors and electronic devices by means of low-powered laser weapons, leaving then
unable to work normally. The installation of high-powered laser weapons on aircraft and other airborne platforms in
order to attack enemy low-orbit spacecraft can greatly enhance the survival capabilities and operational effectiveness
of the laser weapons, making it even harder for the enemy to protect against them. Third is to use information
confrontation means to attack enemy spacecraft. Carrying out deception and jamming from the ground, the sea, and the air
against enemy satellites and other spacecraft, and countering the use of [these spacecraft’s] signals are effective
methods for ground attacks against space.

6. Space service and support units

Space service and support units primarily consist of technical assistance support, logistics service support, and
security support auxiliary organizations and units, composed of various types of service and support personnel.

Technical assistance support units primarily are responsible for providing space systems with relevant technical
assistance support such as weather, mapping, communications, and information applications management. Because space
engineering systems are quite complex, they require quite large technical assistance support units before it is possible
to for them to complete arduous space operations missions, and command, control, communications, computer, and
intelligence systems [sic] (C4ISR) are the most basic technical assistance support system.

Logistics service support units primarily are responsible for the maintenance and management of spacecraft; for the
supply and support of materials and fuel; for the clothing, food, housing, and actions of operations personnel; and for
the construction of relevant engineering facilities. This includes maintenance and repairs in the retrieval and return
of spacecraft (they have corresponding maintenance centers and repair workshops); the construction, protection, and
management of important military facilities like spacecraft launch sites, military airfields, and missile sites; and
supporting and supplying the large number of necessities for space systems and the various kinds of

complex materials and fuels. In particular, support for the lives of astronaut units and for their medical treatment and
hygiene is much more complicated and difficult than for other services, requiring specialized knowledge and the setting
up of special organizations.

Security support units are primarily responsible for the security of space systems’ ground bases and for carrying out
such support duties as security guards, defense, mobility, camouflage, and shelter. The ground systems in space
operations are the basis for engaging in space operations, the ground control systems for space engineering have an
extremely important role for spacecraft that carry out space missions, and whether they are secure or not has a direct
impact on smoothly carrying out space operations.

# II. The structure of personnel in space operations strengths...59

Space operations are confrontations between advanced and new technological space [weapons and equipment] and space
defense weapons and equipment, but even more, they are contests between high-quality new types of military persons of
talent. For this reason, only by fully utilizing the educational resources of military and local colleges; by increasing
the intensity of training for military space persons of talent; by striving to foster and create large numbers of
high-quality military space persons of talent who have mastered advanced theories of operations, who have fairly high
levels of strategizing, and who are proficient in space technology and equipment; and by creating ranks of new types of
space operations persons of talent, is it possible to meet the needs of the construction of space operations strengths
and [the needs] of space operations. These strengths primarily consist of four types of personnel: command personnel,
staff personnel, technical personnel, and operating personnel.

1. “Composite-type” command personnel of talent for space operations “Composite-type” space operations command personnel
of talent refers to those composite-type senior military personnel of talent who not only are proficient at the command
and management of operations, but who also have fairly deep space technology knowledge and skill, and who in addition
have an advanced sense of innovation and the ability for strategic thinking. With the rapid developments in space
operations weapons and equipment, there has been a more widespread penetration and influence between command and
management [on the one hand] and engineering technology [on the other], and qualified space operations command personnel
must not only be proficient at military command, but they must also have a solid basic knowledge of science and culture,
a [solid] knowledge of engineering technology, and a [solid] knowledge of related space technologies before it is
possible to scientifically use space systems and informationized systems to carry out command of operations and to
control new types of weapons and equipment for space operations; otherwise, no matter how advanced command and control
are and [how advanced] weapons and equipment are, it will be difficult to bring into play the effect that they should
have. Future space operations inevitably will be joint operations under informationized conditions, and they will place
even higher demands upon the quality of commanders’ command of joint operations, from the space of operations and the
scope of coordination to the decision-making level and the span of command.

2. “Resourceful-type” staff personnel of talent for space operations

Battlefield situations in space operations change in the twinkling of an eye, and the amount of information is great;
commanders at each echelon must quickly and resolutely make decisions, and this is inseparable from the vigorous help of
“resourceful-type” staff personnel. Space operations often have a very powerful strategic nature, and integrated
information network systems often become key targets for enemy attacks, requiring staff personnel to be “strategic”
personnel of talent who are skilled at macroscopically organizing space operations support; space operations weapons and
equipment are the crystallization of continual developments in advanced science and technology, requiring that staff
personnel must be “composite-type” persons of talent who not only understand command and management but who also
understand specialized technology. Space operations in joint operations under informationized conditions will be
launched in threedimensional spheres of space in such multiple dimensions as the land, sea, air, space,
electromagnetics, the network, and knowledge, and operational command requires highly integrated operations by services
and service arms as well as specialized knowledge of command and control, and this requires that staff personnel must be
“composite-type” persons of talent with a broad knowledge. Science and technology are continually applied to space
systems, and information technology and space technological support must be coordinated with space operations theory
which is being constantly innovated, before it is possible to win victory, and this requires that staff personnel must
be “innovative-type” persons of talent who have a powerful sense of innovation.

3. “Specialist-type” technological personnel of talent for space operations

Functions in space operations, such as monitoring, assistance, operations, and service support, are all done through
military space engineering systems, and any link in military space engineering systems is inseparable from meticulous
operations by scientists and engineering technical experts. In addition to space engineering technology itself,
extremely complicated related support work is also required, such as electronic technology, automation technology, power
technology, materials technology, remote

sensing technology, computer science, chemistry, combustion, thermal physics, and manufacturing technology; these all
require that relevant technical personnel carry out service support, and they require a huge, technologically superb
cadre for equipment technology support.

4. “Knowledge-type” operating personnel of talent for space operations

Operating personnel of talent for space operations are the basic strengths by which space systems generate combat
capabilities. If a single battle position in an operations system is in error, this could lead to the entire system
being paralyzed. In particular, how qualified specialized backbone [cadres] are will directly affect [how and whether]
the functions of operations systems will be brought into play in a normal manner. As regards astronauts, their selection
and training is extremely complex and arduous; they generally are selected from among outstanding pilots, who not only
need to have excellent physical and psychological qualities, but who also need to be skilled at and have mastered space
technology and specialized operating skills. They must also have a grasp on necessary medical knowledge and on the
technology for saving themselves, and the training time lasts four to five years. Therefore, only by striving to foster
a group of specialized backbone [cadres] for technological operations, so that they have mastered new knowledge and new
theories, are familiar with new equipment, and have attained excellent new skills, is it possible to achieve an optimal
combination of man and weapons, and to thus bring into play the maximum operational effectiveness of space weapons and
equipment.

# III. The characteristics of space operations strengths...61

Space operations strengths are typical high-tech strengths; they have the outstanding characteristics of a complex
structure, huge investment, great riskiness, and a high benefit-cost ratio.

# 1. Their structure is complex

Unlike other operational strengths, the structure of space operations strengths is quite complicated; as regards types
of units, there are six types: space launch and recovery units, space tracking units, spaceflight combat units,
strategic missile units, ground space defense units, and space service support units. As regards types of personnel,
there are five types: command personnel, operations staff, space specialists and technical personnel, operational
control personnel, and ground service support personnel. Specifically as regards every type of unit, they all include
many subsystems, and the subsystems also can be further refined. For example, space tracking units include ground
tracking stations and tracking ships at sea, and each tracking station and each survey ship also is a technologically
complex subsystem. In addition, looking at the nature of the constituent components, although the main body in space
operations strengths is military space strengths, still, large numbers of civilian space strengths inevitably will be
requisitioned in wartime, thus forming an integrated military-civilian system of operational strengths. In actuality,
the demarcation between the military and civilians in space operations strengths is quite vague; for example, most of
the communications, navigational, weather, maritime, and geodetic satellites are used by both the military and
civilians, and it is even more true that the various ground tracking strengths can be used by the military but can also
be used by civilians. It is precisely for this reason that in the several recent local wars, the United States used
large numbers of civilian space strengths, and a great many countries in the world have not strictly differentiated
between the military and civilian nature of space strengths; the militaries of some countries, such as India and Japan,
have even relied to a great extent upon the information provided in peacetime by civilian communications, navigation,
weather, and geodetic satellites.

# 2. Investment is huge

Space operations strengths are the use of a nation’s comprehensive national power in the sphere of space, prominently
reflecting its levels of manpower, materiel, finances, and scientific and technological strengths. The huge complexity
of systems structures, the fairly long cycles of research and development, the high costs of testing and equipment, and
the complexity of production have determined that research and development of spacecraft and their ground infrastructure
are very costly. At the same time, spacecraft generally have a fairly short lifespan, and therefore their launch and
recovery, tracking and management, and information use all require investing large amounts of manpower and materiel. In
addition, the testing, repair, and maintenance of space weapons and equipment, as well as the supplementary materials
that they consume, also require paying a very great economic price. According to estimates, constructing a large-scale
space station costs $\$ 50$ billion to $\$ 60$ billion, constructing an aircraft carrying laser weapons costs about $\$
900$ million, research and development of a large-scale communications satellite costs $\$ 100$ to $\$ 300$ million, and
research and development of a space robot also costs $\$ 150$ million. A single flight of a space shuttle costs $\$ 1$
billion, and maintaining it one time costs $\$ 74$ million. Currently, delivery of a kilogram of effective payload into
space costs up to $\$ 5,000$ to $\$ 10,000$ . This then requires heavy funding and resources. Because of the high
manufacturing costs of space technological equipment and the expensive maintenance costs, even military powers find it
very difficult to maintain a huge, fully functional space equipment system in peacetime, and therefore what they
basically have adopted is a “joint military-civilian use that combines peace and war” model of constructions.

3. High riskiness

The high-tech nature of space systems’ development is strong, and the impact of the environment of their special
physical space is great; moreover, as the levels of space confrontations have risen, this has led to an extremely large
number of factors in the security issues of military space systems and especially of their weapons and equipment
systems, so that the fragility of the system of space operations strengths is quite pronounced. First, the structure of
space operations strengths is complex. Linkage in space systems is strong, and as soon as a given part is destroyed,
this will affect how the functions of the entire system are brought into play. For example, just a single carrier rocket
in a space system will consist of several hundred thousand or up to a million parts. From the research and development,
testing, and production of spacecraft to their launching, tracking, and use, problems that appear in any link or any
part or component will affect their operating efficiency in light cases, while in heavy cases, it will lead to failure
of the entire mission and even create disastrous consequences. The loss in 1986 of the United States’ Challenger space
shuttle was because one rubber washer had poor quality, creating a major plane crash incident. Second is the threat of
the space environment. Spacecraft that operate in space orbit not only are put into very powerful cosmic radiation, but
they also are threatened by such factors as space fragments and intense changes in temperatures. For example, in July
1996, France’s Cerise satellite’s gravity gradient stabilization boom was bit by a fragment from its Ariane [carrier]
rocket, and the upper part of this was cut off, so that the attitude control system was damaged, which led to there
being no way for the satellite to operate normally. Third is that it is easy for the system of space operations
strengths to come under enemy attack. Ground space infrastructure will be the focus of enemy long-range precision attack
weapons’ raids in warfare, and it will be difficult to conceal spacecraft deployed for extensive periods of time in
space. Moreover, because of the restraints of the laws of physics, they operate in fixed orbits, so that their actions
can be predicted; their ability for mobile response is limited, it is easy for the enemy to stay abreast of their
operational intentions, and it is easy for them to be tracked and aimed at and to suffer interference and attack. Fourth
is that spacecraft’s self-defense measures are limited and their defense capabilities weak. Currently, the issue of
space systems’ own security has yet to be resolved; civilian spacecraft have yet to take measures for defense, while the
defense measures of military spacecraft are also quite limited, so that their defense abilities are quite fragile. Even
when spacecraft have an accident, it is very hard to judge whether this is man-made damage or natural damage;
maintenance and resupply capabilities are even more insufficient, and even when astronauts are sent on space shuttles
into space to carry out repairs in orbit, drawbacks exist where the amount of time consumed is long, costs are high, and
risks are great.

4. High benefit-cost ratio

Although there is heavy consumption in the development of space operations strengths, the benefit-cost ratio is very
high. This is because militarily, it is possible to engage in space confrontations and protect the nation’s sovereignty
and rights and interests through strengthening and using space operations strengths. As regards science and technology,
use of the exploratory nature and traction of military space development impels major advances in space, information,
materials, and other related technologies. Economically, not only can it create an excellent platform for economic
development and provide a secure environment, but space resources can also be put directly into civilian use.
Politically and diplomatically, technological monopoly and cooperation in the development of space, as well as the space
deterrence that is formed, not only can provide means for the diplomatic struggle, but they also help to enhance a
nation’s status and prestige, and strengthen the nation’s overall national strength. What is even more important is that
space technology has a dual military-civilian nature; its facilities, like space communications, satellite remote
sensing, navigation and positioning, and mapping and weather, can be put directly into service for the nation’s economic
and social development. Although the United States’ Apollo moon landing program consumed $\$ 25$ billion, it produced
$\$ 200$ billion in economic benefits and spurred more than 500 hightech inventions, and more than 3,000 technological
results derived from it. These technologies ultimately were all put to civilian use and into the national defense
military industry, thus establishing the United States’ superior scientific and technological position. The development
of space operations strengths can vigorously promote the transformation of military and civilian space technologies into
one another as well as [promote] their interactive development.

# Section 2: The Main Missions of Space Operations Strengths...63

In joint operations under informationized conditions, given that space operations strengths are an important component
part of the armed forces system, their main missions consist of deploying space strengths, space information assistance
and support, trans-atmospheric transportation support, space assaults, space defense, and space blockades; their goal is
to seize and hold command of space and to assist surface operations on the earth. These missions can be summarized into
three grand missions: access to space, the use of space, and the control of space.

# I. Access to space...64

Access to space refers to a series of space activities that are carried out for completing military missions: launching
spacecraft into predetermined orbits, safely operating the spacecraft in orbit, and servicing and returning the
spacecraft. It is one of the important missions of space operations strengths, it is a basic condition for building up
space operations strengths, and it is a basic means for developing the deployment of space operations strengths. Access
to space is a precondition and basis for using space and controlling space, and it is an issue that each country must
first resolve in developing its space enterprises. The United States has already treated “ensuring access” as a crucial
objective in the US military’s development of space operations strengths. The US military’s joint Space Command pointed
out in its Long-Term Planning – Vision for 2020 that “Ensuring access” means “the use as needed” of space traffic
routes, and [it means] achieving unimpeded movement in and through space. This is extremely important for carrying out
space operations missions. Various countries are developing their ability to access space, and this is primarily done
through three areas.

The first is space launches. This primarily means launching spacecraft into predetermined orbits and having them operate
normally, and [it also means] the ability to retrieve spacecraft from space based on need. This kind of space launch not
only requires transporting an effective payload to mission orbit, but it also requires ensuring that the access
transport is inexpensive, that its response is timely, and that it can access [space] at any time. For this reason,
completing space launch missions not only requires having many ways and means of space launch during peacetime, but what
is even more important is having the ability during wartime to quickly launch into space under conditions where [the
launches] suffer jamming, blocking, and attacks. Only in this way is it possible to quickly replenish lost or damaged
spacecraft under various conditions, and to deploy equipment or operational personnel as needed. In order to improve
rapid emergency-response capabilities in wartime, the various space powers in the world all are vigorously developing
the ability to quickly access space. This ability includes many aspects: carrier tools must be ready-made as well as
modularized and systematized, and be able to adjust to the needs of differing payloads and orbits; the interface between
spacecraft and carrier tools must be versatile; the carrier tools must be mobile and be able to move to nearby suitable
launch points within a short period of time; the launch preparation time is short; and there must be a complete mobile
tracking system for carrier tools.

Second is secure control in orbit of spacecraft. This primarily means providing global telemetry, tracking, and command
of spacecraft in orbit, and the ability to adjust the orbit and position of an orbiting satellite in a timely manner,
based on the needs of military operations. Secure control over a space[craft] in orbit requires having the ability to
analyze the situation without any hindrance and without interruption, especially under conditions of wartime where the
enemy is carrying out powerful electromagnetic jamming, and while you are quickly correcting mission data. In order to
have secure

control in orbit on a global scale, the two space powers – the United States and Russia – have both come up with ways to
set up space tracking stations around the entire globe, with the goal of enhancing the secure reliability of space
tracking. Given the restraints of its national characteristics, the PRC in addition to setting up overseas tracking
stations by leasing them, primarily uses the method of overseas tracking ships to resolve the issue of global secure
control over spacecraft in orbit.

Third is servicing and recovering spacecraft. This primarily means replacing parts and refueling spacecraft in orbit,
and recovering valuable and important effective payloads. Because of the cost issue, servicing in orbit is restricted to
high-value systems, such as expansive and lightweight tracking sensors and materials that are politically sensitive;
most of them are deployed to deal with crises or military needs, and they are not necessary in peacetime. Most of the
spacecraft that need to be retrieved in peacetime are spaceships and space shuttles; they are important means by which
mankind explores outer space, as well as basic tools by which humans live in outer space.

# II. Use of space...65

The use of space refers to bringing into play the role that space operations strengths have for assisting and supporting
land, sea, and air joint operations. This is a direct goal in access to space, as well as the most important operational
mission that space operations strengths currently have. Practices in the several local wars since the 1990s have shown
that the information assistance and support that space operations strengths have provided, such as reconnaissance and
surveillance, missile early warning, communications relay, navigation and positioning, weather observations, and earth
surveying, have played a “multiplier” effect in improving the process of operational capabilities, and are crucial,
valuable, and indispensable factors in integrated joint operations under informationized conditions. For example, in the
Kosovo Campaign, the US military mobilized nearly twenty types of satellites, for a total of over fifty of them, and
together with early warning aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and various types of sensors and special operations
intelligence personnel on the ground, they formed an integrated information network system at the strategic, campaign,
and tactical levels, which carried out real-time monitoring and control throughout Kosovo and on the various
battlefields, in all times and spaces and in all directions. In this, space strengths undertook more than seventy
percent of battlefield communications tasks, more than eighty percent of battlefield reconnaissance and surveillance
tasks, and 100 percent of weather support tasks, providing guidance information for ninety-eight percent of the
precision attack weapons and twenty-four-hour continuous monitoring of theater of war communications signals. It can be
said that fully utilizing space made indispensable contributions to the United States winning victory in the Kosovo
Campaign.

Looking at current technological conditions, the major missions in the use of space are first, reconnaissance and
surveillance missions. These include dynamic surveillance of the battlefield; this primarily means finding and
identifying how enemy troop strengths and weapons are deployed, such as transfers and deployment of various kinds of
hightech weapons and equipment and the construction of major military fortifications, while at the same time monitoring
how the enemy is preparing the battlefield and changes in his posture. [They also include] carrying out electronic
reconnaissance; this primarily means determining the various kinds of enemy ground radars, the precision placement of
radio stations, and signals characteristics and operating distances, through tracking and collecting enemy
electromagnetic signals, and verifying the intelligence acquired by visible-light and infrared imaging reconnaissance.
[Finally, they include] carrying out maritime surveillance. This primarily is done though target imagery and
intercepting signals emitted by shipborne radars, communications, and other radio equipment, and through integrated
processing to detect and track surface ships and floating bases, while at the same time measuring coastal terrain, the
rise and fall in sea levels, ocean temperatures, the formation of typhoons, wind strength and wind direction, currents,
and the distribution of sea ice. Second is the mission of missile early warning. This primarily means tracking and
monitoring enemy missile sites, aircraft, and ships; having a real-time grasp of their missile launch situation; and
providing prompt missile early warning intelligence so as to win as much time as possible for your side to organize
missile interception and to protect your important targets. Third is communications relay missions. These primarily are
the forwarding or emissions of radio signals, in order to carry out communications among surface communications devices,
between surface communications devices and spacecraft, and between one spacecraft and another; providing transmission of
voice, images, and data over long distances, in great volumes, and at high speeds; and ensuring delivery of rapid,
reliable, and encrypted battlefield information among the supreme command, joint operations command, command of the
various services and service arms, and their subordinate units. Fourth is the mission of missile positioning. This
primarily means providing navigational and positioning assistance for precision-guided weapons, in order to enhance the
precision of their aim, and providing accurate three-dimensional position, speed, and time information for the various
services’ and service arms’ units, operational platforms, and weapons systems. This thus ensures that troop strengths
and firepower can overcome the effects of an adverse natural environment; that they move accurately, quickly, and in a
timely manner; and that they thus form a decisive superiority over the enemy at the most appropriate times and places.
Fifth is weather observation missions. These primarily obtain weather information for the entire globe or for a specific
region and predict developments and changes in the weather situation, by means of weather observations for the earth and
its atmosphere, thus providing weather support for units at each echelon. Sixth is earth surveying missions. These
primarily provide such materials as how the shape of the earth, the earth’s gravity field, and the earth’s magnetic
field are distributed, which are used to improve the technical performance of the various kinds of precision-guided
weapons, and they measure the positions, altitudes, and landforms of the various targets on a ground battlefield, in
order to draft detailed and precise military maps.

# II. Control of space...66

Looking at its essence, control of space means seizing and keeping command of space; it is an important guarantee for
using space. What is referred to as command of space means dominance over a certain regions of space at a specific
period of time. Under informationized conditions, once you hold command of space, and have won superiority where the
high dimensions of space (information and [outer] space) restrain the low dimensions of space (the land, sea, and air),
you are then able to effectively support your own combatant troop strengths’ freedom of movement; to provide
information, firepower, and trans-atmospheric transportation support for land, sea, and air domains; to restrain the
assistance and support roles of your opponent’s space operations strengths; and even to directly carry out intense
firepower attacks against the earth’s surface, thus greatly weakening your opponent’s overall operational capabilities.
Therefore, whether or not you are able to control space and to seize and keep command of space directly affects victory
or defeat in war, and so its status is quite important.

There are primarily three missions in the control of space. The first is to enhance the survival capability of
spacecraft, so that when they encounter jamming, damaging, or destructive attacks, they can perceive these in a timely
manner and strengthen their protection. The second is that, when necessary, they will jam, damage, or destroy hostile
nation’s orbiting spacecraft or other applications systems that [pose] a threat. The third is direct support to ground
operations by means of space-based weapons, particularly in attacking the enemy’s in-depth nodal targets of a strategic
nature.

There are many methods for fulfilling the mission of control of space, but looking at them overall, there are [just]
three: space blockades, space attacks, and space defense. Space blockades use offensive weapons to form a screen between
space and the ground, preventing enemy space strengths from accessing the space battlefield or moving in orbit, and from
exchanging information with ground systems; it includes four types: blockades of space bases, orbit blockades, blockades
of transmission channels, and information blockades. Space attacks are the comprehensive use of the means of soft and
hard kill (destruction, denial, weakening, jamming, and deception) to attack enemy space targets or targets on the
earth’s surface (on land, at sea, or in the air), with the goal of reducing or depriving the enemy’s right to use space,
and to assist your own side’s land, sea, and air operations. Space defense is the adoption of various active and passive
measures and

actions to defend against assaults by enemy space strengths and attacks by ballistic missiles; its goal is to keep your
own country’s space systems and its important land, sea, and air targets from coming under attack by enemy space systems
or ground-based weapons systems. It includes three types: anti-missile, defense against spacecraft, and defense against
space bases. The most effective method for achieving the goal of controlling space is direct destruction of the enemy’s
orbiting spacecraft. For this reason, the United States, Russia, and other countries have developed large numbers of
antisatellite weapons, such as anti-satellite satellites, laser weapons, and microwave weapons. The United States has
even proposed deploying space-based laser weapons systems before 2020, and to deploy space fighter units in space in
2025, in order to hunt enemy nations’ spacecraft at any time. It can be affirmed that as space technology develops, the
struggle among the major space nations of the world over control of space inevitably will intensify.

# Section 3: The Status and Role of Space Operations Strengths...68

Space operations strengths hold the high ground on the informationized battlefield, and they exert a major impact on
operational actions on the earth’s surface. They are strategic strengths for protecting national security, they are
important strengths for carrying out strategic deterrence, they are crucial strengths in struggling for the initiative,
and they are key factors and links for shaping the ability for systemic operations.

# I. Strategic strengths for protecting national security...68

As humanity has entered the Space Age, the categories of national interests have gradually transcended the traditional
[ones of] land, territorial seas, and the air, and they have continually expanded and been extended toward space. The
nation’s security boundaries have also accordingly been extended from geographical frontiers that are bounded to the
vast [reaches of] space, which have no bounds, and the ranges have been greatly expanded. Threats to space security have
become a completely new threat that national security faces. Because the development of space will have a comprehensive
role in promoting development and transformation in each sphere of the nation, the impact of space security will
therefore not be limited merely to outer space, but will penetrate and radiate to almost every aspect of the nation’s
political security, economic security, information security, maritime security, environmental security, financial
security, energy security, production security, and cultural security, becoming a support for every sphere of national
security; its impact on national development and on the expansion of interests will become increasingly important. It
can be said that without space security, it will be difficult to get effective guarantees for other [types of] security.
As the “high frontier” and “security umbrella” of national security, space security has become an important

component part of national security. As major strengths for protecting national space security, space operations
strengths are a new type of and crucially important strategic strength, as well as the symbolic strength of the status
of a great power in the twenty-first century. Historically, naval military strengths and nuclear strengths have one
after the other been the symbolic strengths of a world power. The sea covers seventy percent of the earth’s surface area
and is a major channel for mankind’s exchanges and an important support for his existence; after market economies
replaced natural economies to become the dominant form of mankind’s production, naval military strengths became an
important symbol of a powerful country’s domination. Nuclear weapons pushed mankind’s violence to the extreme, and they
had an extremely great deterrent role against opponents; they therefore became the symbol of the status of a great power
in the twentieth century and even today they are still a stick than a number of countries chase after. But in the
twenty-first century, if you do not have space operations strengths or if your space operations strengths are not
strong, and if you cannot effectively use outer space and protect your own space interests, you will be unable to become
a world power in the true sense of the term.

# II. Important strengths for carrying out strategic deterrence...69

Military deterrence has existed since ancient times, and as people’s understanding of military deterrence has
continually deepened and as practices of military deterrence have constantly developed, military deterrence, with its
increasingly diversified methods and means, has become an important component part of operational actions and has played
a role that is ever more important. Threatening the use or limited use of space operations strengths often can have a
major deterrent effect on the enemy, producing psychological fear and forcing him to abandon his operational intentions
or controlling the scale and intensity of [his] operations and means of operations, thus creating a beneficial
environment and situation for your own side’s joint operations. Space deterrence, compared to nuclear deterrence,
information deterrence, and conventional deterrence, is flexible in its use, has a high degree of credibility, and is
characterized by its global, rapid, and highly effective nature. Spacecraft flying at high speeds in space can threaten
any target in the spheres of land, sea, air, and space, and truly have the ability for “global reach and global
operations;” space operations strengths are not limited by any political or geographical conditions and can quickly
arrive at any assault region in the world, attack any region or target within the enemy’s borders, and force the enemy
to submit. Space weapons and equipment are characterized by high precision and great power, and this not only ensures
that space attacks are highly effective, but it also reduces collateral damage to a maximum extent. Therefore, space
deterrence has increasingly become an important form of deterrence, and this has been an emerging trend in recent local
wars.

# III. Crucial strengths in seizing the initiative in warfare...69

Practices in the world’s several recent wars have shown that seizing command of space has become a prerequisite
condition for seizing information dominance, command of the air, and command of the sea, and has become crucial in
seizing and holding the initiative in warfare; it directly affects the course and outcome of the war. If we say that the
core of mechanized warfare is command of the air, then the core of informationized warfare is command of space. No
matter whether it is the buildup of space operations strengths or it is space operations, the heart of it is for seizing
command of space. Without control over space, there is no use talking about control over land, sea, and the air; command
of space has become a new focus that the two sides struggle for, following [their focus on] control over the land,
command of the sea, and command of the air. In carrying out integrated joint operations under informationized
conditions, these often do not commence on land, at sea, or in the air, but they begin first from space and they begin
with command of space. Control of space and seizing command of space has continually been listed by such military powers
as the United States and Russia as important strategic objectives for taking the initiative and for seizing superiority
on the battlefield in future wars. Early on in the 1960s, former US President [John F.] Kennedy believed that whoever
controlled space would control the initiative in warfare. The United States has emphasized that by the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm
{ s t } } \cdot$ century, its reliance on space capabilities will be just like the reliance that the survival and
development of industry in the nineteenth and twentieth century had on electrical power and petroleum, and that space
will become even more the focus of the United States’ national security and national interests. Starting in 2001, the
United States has held a space operations simulation exercise almost every two years; its goal is to explore the
characteristics and laws of space operations and to test the feasibility of theory for the command of space. As the main
strengths in space operations, space strengths can create extremely favorable prerequisite conditions for seizing
control over the land, command of the air, and command of the sea, through seizing command of space, and they will thus
seize the initiative in war. Speaking in this sense, space operations strengths will be crucial strengths for seizing
the initiative in warfare.

# IV. Key factors and links in shaping the capabilities of systemic operations...70

Joint operations under informationized conditions are integrated operations by strengths in multidimensional spaces,
such as the land, sea, air, space, electromagnetics, the network, and knowledge; space operations strengths have unique
advantages in collecting, processing, and transmitting information as well as the ability to carry out space offensive
and defensive operations. They have already become an important component part of the system of joint operations under
informationized conditions, and play the role of an “adhesive” link as the capability for systemic operations takes
shape.

In other words, the buildup of space operations strengths is an important link in a healthy system of joint operations
strengths, and is an effective way to rapidly enhance joint operations capabilities under informationized conditions and
for shaping the abilities for systemic operations. First, space information systems are the foundation that military
command information systems rely on for their operating. Space information systems can have the function of an
information center and link, forming an integrated overall information network system, and organically combine
reconnaissance, surveillance, early warning, communications, navigation, positioning, and mapping, thus forming an
integrated overall information network system. Moreover, it links land, sea, air, space, and electronic offensive and
defensive strengths into a multi-dimensional integrated system of operations, carrying out precise, rapid, and highly
effective command, control, and attacks, and thus joining the various combatant strengths into an organic whole, by
means of a network. They are interlinked, they supplement each other, and they support one another, to achieve victory
in their joint operations in a coordinated manner. Just as the US military points out in its Vision for Space 2020,6
military satellite systems are able to bring into play the operational potential of traditional military strengths to a
maximum degree, and play a role in combining and multiplying traditional military strengths. Second, ground forces,
naval, and air force operational strengths have extended the distance of their operations and the accuracy of their
hits, with the information assistance and support of space operations strengths. Using the information superiority of
spacebased information systems, it is possible to provide precise target information, navigation and positioning, and
communications relay for the various types of weapons platforms and equipment, thus clearly improving their ability for
long-distance precision movement, adding to the forms of deployment for weapons and equipment, and increasing the
distance of operations, accuracy of hits, and destructive effectiveness of ground forces, naval, and air force weapons
platforms and equipment to an unprecedented degree. At the same time, the precision reconnaissance and rapid
communications through satellites help in passive protection and active defense, and also help in evaluating and
[providing] feedback about the results of attacks. Third, the mobile superiority of the rapid flight of space offensive
operations strengths and the firepower superiority of long-range attacks by space weapons and equipment are also an
important foundation for carrying out long-range precision attacks.

# Section 4: The Use of Space Operations Strengths...71

Based on the characteristics of space operations strengths, their operational goals, and the laws of space operations,
scientific and accurate use of space operations strengths are a

primary condition for seizing the initiative in space operations and for winning victory in space operations.

# I. Unified command and prudent use...71

As an operational strength of a strategic nature, space operations strengths’ use affects the overall situation of
operations and national security, and it is necessary to stand at the vantage point of strategy; to give comprehensive
consideration to the various political, economic, diplomatic, and military factors; and to make prudent decisions. In
particular, hard kill actions against enemy satellites, spacecraft, and other space systems have a major impact on the
overall situation, and it is even more necessary to be extremely prudent and to make thorough preparations, so as to
prevent enemy retaliation. The US military has already declared that an attack by any country against its space systems
is equivalent to a nuclear war against the United States. As the number of spacecraft in outer space has rapidly
increased, the various nations’ military and civilian spacecraft operating in differing orbits have formed an interwoven
situation, directly affecting the deployment and orbital movements of your own side’s space operations strengths, as
well as the identification and tracking of enemy spacecraft. Once you take action in space operations, it is extremely
possible that [these actions] will affect the normal work of neutral parties’ spacecraft and even create “accidental
damage;” particularly under current conditions where we lack the basis of effective and standard space laws, it will be
easy for this to lead to intense international contradictions and disputes. Therefore, given that space operations
strengths are one of the strategic strengths of the nation, the sensitivity in using them is extremely strong, and their
use must be subordinate to and serve the needs of the overall national security situation. Under normal conditions,
space operations should involve unified planning and unified decision-making by the supreme command organization of a
joint operation, and they may even require the supreme leader of a nation or the supreme headquarters of the military to
directly give an operational order, and command authority has the feature of being highly centralized and unified.
Unified command is a guarantee for achieving optimal combinations of the various types of operational resources and for
carrying out highly effective and stable space operations, and it is the foundation for a unified will to fight, for
unified operational actions, for strengthening operational capabilities, and for achieving the goals of operations.

To exercise unified command over the operations of space operations strengths, it is first necessary to centralize
control over space [strengths] and space defense strengths. Centralized control, as reflected in the objectives of the
operation, requires determining the objectives in the use of space operations strengths, in accordance with the overall
intentions of joint operations; as reflected in organization and planning, it is necessary to keep an eye on the overall
situation and overall course of joint operations, and to make overall plans for the operational actions of space
operations strengths. [Finally,] as reflected in the use of troop strengths and weapons, it is necessary to carry out
integrated mastery and unified use of space-based directed energy, kinetic energy, and other powerful weapons and of
such elite strengths as spaceflight units. Second, you should fully bring into play the role of networked information
systems, in order to organically combine strategic decision-making, campaign command, and tactical actions. Networked
information systems not only are the spiritual center of the joint operations system, but they also are a basic means
for unifying command over space operations strengths. Through the networked information system, it is not only necessary
to have space launch units, tracking units, spaceflight combat units, ground space defense units, support units, and
defensive units share information and have information flow among them, but it is also necessary to closely coordinate
and cooperate with the various services’ and service arms’ strengths of the ground forces, navy, and air force, and to
strengthen close coordination with relevant local departments, fully utilizing all civilian space strengths that can be
used.

# II. Joint use and integrated operations...72

In future operations, only by joining together the diversified operational strengths that participate in space
operations, forming an organic whole, is it possible to bring into play the maximum effectiveness of operations, using
overall combined strengths to win victory in space operations. On the one hand, it is necessary to bring about the joint
use of the various services’ and service arms’ strengths. Space operations are joint operations carried out in common by
the various services and service arms, and given that space operations strengths are the main body in space operations,
they primarily undertake such operational missions as deterrence, command of space, information confrontations, space
assaults, and support, while other operational strengths, such as the ground forces, Navy, Air Force, and Second
Artillery not only can use such operational means as long-range precision attacks, special operations, electronic
warfare, and cyber warfare to jam, damage, and paralyze the enemy’s space operations system and to assist their own
side’s space operations strengths in seizing command of space, but they also can provide effective protection for
land-based, sea-based, and air-based space operations strengths, thus ensuring their survival. Therefore, organically
combining the strengths of the various services and service arms that participate in space operations, in order to carry
out overall operations, can make up for deficiencies in your own side’s space operations strengths and weapons and
equipment, strengthening the overall capabilities of space operations. On the other hand, it is necessary to break
through the boundaries between the military and civilians, thus achieving the joint use of military and civilian space
strengths. Space technology has military and civilian compatibility, and while the number and scale of military space
operations strengths are limited, the development of civilian space systems has been quite rapid, with certain of its
performance metrics already approaching or even surpassing those of military space systems, so they can undertake some
of the support to operational missions. As long as civilian space systems keep an “interface” with military space
systems, they will be able to become important component parts of combatant strength systems within space operations,
and meet the needs of space operations. During the Gulf War and the Kosovo Campaign, civilian communications satellites
were responsible for forty percent and sixty percent, respectively, of the US military’s communications duties. In
future informationized wars, with the unified planning, coordination, and use of military and civilian space systems in
order to achieve the integrated operations of many types of space strengths, it will be possible to fully bring into
play the roles of civilian space strengths, to make up for insufficiencies in the number and scale of military space
strengths. In addition, you should also pay attention to using the space strengths and resources of friendly countries
or allies in order to strengthen your own side’s space operational capabilities. Through drafting relevant space
treaties and agreements with friendly countries or allies, and establishing cooperation mechanisms of mutual trust, it
is possible to use third parties’ space strengths to assist your own side’s space operations actions in wartime, under
conditions where your own side’s space operations systems have been jammed, damaged, or destroyed by the enemy.

# III. With a focus on attack, have both offense and defense...73

An active offense is the only means to gain victory in warfare. On the one hand, space operations strengths have
powerful information support capabilities, global mobility capabilities, and the ability to attack in all spheres; on
the other hand, military spacecraft sailing and operations in space follow relatively fixed orbital movements, and their
selfdefense capabilities are not strong, while their ground space assistance and support systems are large targets, with
fixed positions, spread over a broad area, with obvious characteristics, and with a weak ability to resist attacks, so
it is not easy to organize their defense. Therefore, space operations strengths have the attributes where they are
strong on offense and weak on defense, and as military space technology rapidly develops and is constantly turned into
space weapons and equipment, the imbalance where space operations strengths are strong on offense and weak on defense
will become more pronounced. In addition, space operations strengths also are a double-edged sword; not only is it
possible to construct a “shield” for defense, but it is also possible to forge them into a “sharp sword” for offense.
For example, missile defense systems where space operations strengths are the main body not only promptly and accurately
find and effectively intercept long-range offensive weapons that the enemy has launched, ensuring that their own side
will avoid the enemy’s attack, but they also can use military space systems to conduct reconnaissance and positioning
and can use ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and combat aircraft to directly and precisely attack the enemy’s
long-range weapons systems and important targets, thus weakening, damaging, and even destroying the enemy’s operations
system.

When space operations strengths are in use, they should seize the initiative, based on their attributes as strengths
that are long on offense, using sudden and violent firepower to carry out suppressive attacks against such targets as
the enemy’s orbiting spacecraft, space launch sites, integrated information systems, and command and control centers,
seizing command of space at one blow and gaining information superiority. On this basis, they should again concentrate
their space operations strengths and the other services’ and services arms’ operational strengths to carry out
long-range precision attacks against the enemy’s key economic, political, and military targets, weakening the enemy’s
potential operational strengths, attacking the enemy’s system of operations, and weakening the enemy people’s morale, up
until they win victory in the operations. At the same time that they carry out active space offensive operational
actions, they should thoroughly organize space defense operations. It is necessary to adopt vigorous defensive measures
for their own orbiting spacecraft, space launch centers, and systems of operations and their key economic and political
targets; to defeat the enemy’s counterattack actions that he carries out against their own side; and to pay attention to
achieving the goal of defense through such active offensive actions as anti-missile and anti-spacecraft operations, thus
avoiding a negative and passive defense.

# IV. Rapid reaction, with a focus on attack...74

Although space strengths have powerful offensive capabilities, space systems themselves are quite fragile, and once they
come under a preemptive attack by the enemy, it is easy for them to become paralyzed and to become totally passive. In
addition, space operations’ own characteristics of fast speeds, rapid rhythm, and heavy consumption also require that
operational actions must have a quick fight and a quick resolution, striving to avoid protracted indecision. Therefore,
space operations strengths must fully bring into play the subjective dynamism of commanders at each echelon and the
rapid reaction capabilities of operational units, and pay attention to carrying out focused attacks against the
opponent’s space operations systems and to paralyzing his organizational systems, in order to seize and hold the
initiative in space operations.

First, it is necessary to be fully prepared. Comprehensive and complete preparations for operations are an important
premise for quick reaction. The commander of space operations strengths and his command organ must command and monitor
space [units] and space defense units in making thorough preparations of all kinds in a timely and concealed manner,
based on the enemy’s space operations intentions and his possible operational actions, as well as their own side’s space
operations missions and operations capabilities and on possible developments and changes in the battlefield situation,
thus ensuring that as soon as a command is given it will be possible to deploy [space strengths] for operations. Only in
this way will it be possible to be faster than the enemy’s operational rhythm and speed, and to quickly achieve the
goals of space operations.

Second, it is necessary to seize the initiative and to have focused attacks. The commander of space operations strengths
and his command organ must accurately ascertain the intentions of the enemy’s space operations and the time, form, and
scale of the first attack that [the enemy] might carry out, and command his units to seize the favorable opportunity
where the enemy has basically completed his preparations for operations but not yet launched his attack, and to adopt
the form of a sudden raid to carry out a destructive attack against the enemy’s important orbiting spacecraft and the
key installations of his space [bases] and space defense bases, in order to try to quickly paralyze the enemy’s entire
system of space operations, so that it will be hard for the enemy’s space [strengths] and space defense strengths to
recover their operational capabilities for a fairly long period of time, and thus you will achieve your own side’s goal
of a quick fight and a quick resolution.

Third, it is necessary to base yourself on repeated struggles. Superiority and inferiority, having the initiative and
being on the defensive are relative postures in operations that the two combatant sides are placed in, and [these
postures] can be switched under certain circumstances. In operations under informationized conditions, the struggle
between the two sides’ space operations strengths for superiority and the initiative will permeate the entire process of
space operations, and it is quite possible that your own side’s space operations strengths will only be able to finally
gain superiority and the initiative in space operations through complicated and protracted struggles with the enemy. For
this reason, it is necessary to exert prolonged pressure in space against the enemy, through continuous blockades and
suppressive actions, and not giving his space operations strengths an opportunity to adjust and recover, thus
maintaining your own side’s superiority and the initiative. When your own side’s space operations strengths come under
enemy attack and temporarily are trapped in passivity, you should adopt such measures as emergency launches, adjusting
your deployments, or enabling backup systems, in order to strive to recover your operational capabilities within the
shortest period of time possible. Through gradually changing the ratio of space [strengths] and space defense strengths
between the two sides, [you can] switch superiority and inferiority, and again take back the initiative in space
operations.

# Questions for Deliberation…75

1. What differences are there between space operations strengths’ unit structures and personnel structures?

2. What are the main missions of space operations strengths?

3. What are the status and role of space operations strengths?

4. What principles should space operations strengths follow in their use?

# Lecture 4 Space Equipment for Space Operations...76

Space equipment for space operations is a new type of weapon and equipment that emerged when science and technology
developed to a certain stage, and it is the physical foundation for future space operations as well as an important
technological guarantee for them. It is an important component part of modern high-tech weapons and equipment and an
important symbol of national defense modernization and composite national strength, and it plays a crucially important
role in seizing superiority in warfare and victory in operations.

Currently, there is as yet no unified and clear definition of space equipment for space operations, either within the
PRC or abroad. The US military rather broadly utilizes the wording “military space systems,” but it has not made any
clear-cut definitions; although the Russian military has mentioned the term military spacecraft equipment, it has not
put forward a conceptual explanation. The theoretical monographs that the PRC military has published over the past few
years have understood [the term] spacecraft equipment for space operations mostly from two areas, a narrow sense and a
broad sense. Speaking in the narrow sense, space equipment refers to various kinds of remote-sensing devices and
monitoring equipment, communications equipment, and weapons systems that are deployed in space and that are used to
carry out such military missions as reconnaissance and surveillance, ballistic missile early warning, military
communications, navigation and target positioning, meteorological monitoring, geodesy, anti-satellite and anti-ballistic
missile, and space offense and defense. Speaking in the broad sense, space equipment is a general term that refers to
weapons and weapons systems that are used in peacetime or wartime to seize command of space and to carry out the
missions of space operations, as well as the military technological equipment and materials that are ancillary to these
[weapons and weapons systems]. These not only include the space equipment and ground applications systems that are
referred to in the narrow sense, as well as the various weapons and equipment that use these as platforms, but they also
include ballistic missiles and the weapons and equipment systems that carry out space operations missions using the
land, sea, and air as their support.

Looking at developmental trends, future warfare inevitably will be integrated joint operations that are carried out in
the multidimensional spaces of land, sea, air, space, and electronics. Based on this situation, the concept that defines
space equipment for space operations in the broad sense is more accurate, that is, space equipment for space operations
is a general term that refers to the spacecraft and space-based weapons systems that are used in peacetime or wartime to
carry out and support space operations missions, as well as their applications systems, carrier tools, and relevant
devices and

installations. Looking at their military applications, they can be specifically divided into three categories. The first
is satellite systems that are already used in large numbers for supporting ground military strengths, such as
reconnaissance satellites, early warning satellites, military communications satellites, navigation satellites,
meteorological satellites, and geodetic satellites. The second is space-based or partially space-based weapons that are
undergoing research and development; this primarily refers to antisatellite systems used by attack spacecraft, including
anti-satellite missiles and various types of space-based directed energy weapons (laser and particle beam weapons). The
third is manned spacecraft that theoretically could carry out military missions but that have only done individual
exploratory tests; these include manned spaceships, space stations, space shuttles, and space planes.

To make it easy to understand, this lecture will focus on the functional roles of space systems, with an emphasis on
five areas: space information collection, space navigation and positioning, space information transmission, space
operations weapons, and ground applications of space resources, as it carries out a systematic explanation and
description of spacecraft equipment.

# Section 1: Space Information Collection Systems...77

Space information collection systems refer to satellite-borne systems that use such reconnaissance devices as
optoelectronic equipment or radio receivers to engage in reconnaissance, surveillance, or tracking from earth orbit
against predetermined targets on the ground, at sea, or in the air, in order to collect the targets’ intelligence
information. Based on differences in their effective payloads and missions, space information collection systems
generally can be divided into satellite imaging reconnaissance systems, satellite electronic reconnaissance systems,
satellite missile early warning and nuclear explosion detection systems, satellite cartographic mapping systems,
satellite ocean monitoring systems, satellite meteorological monitoring and early warning systems, and satellite earth
resources survey systems.

# I. Satellite imagery reconnaissance systems...77

# 1. Overview

Satellite imagery reconnaissance systems are also called satellite photoreconnaissance systems; they refer to
satellite-borne systems that obtain images from the reflected light of the targets being collected against, by means of
visible light and microwave remotesensing devices; they are primarily used to reconnoiter intelligence on airfields,
seaports, missile bases, communications hubs, urban fortifications, industrial layouts, troop

strengths assemblies, and military deployments. Among the various types of satellite reconnaissance systems, imaging
reconnaissance systems were the earliest to develop, and they are the ones that undertake most of the space
reconnaissance and surveillance mission. Their reconnaissance devices usually include visible light cameras, infrared
cameras, multispectral cameras, synthetic aperture radar, and television cameras. Of these, visible light cameras can
get the best ground resolution, and their image data are directly seen and easy to interpret; multispectral and infrared
cameras can identify camouflage, and monitor military actions at night; synthetic aperture radar can carry out
reconnaissance in all weathers and at all times; and television cameras can carry out nearreal-time reconnaissance, thus
shortening the time for collecting intelligence. Because the form in which synthetic aperture radar works is to emit
electromagnetic waves and receive electromagnetic echoes from the target, it has a certain ability to display moving
targets, and it can reconnoiter, track, and monitor dynamic military targets and military activities. Imaging
reconnaissance satellites usually use nearly circular low earth orbits for their activities, at an altitude of less than
1,000 kilometers; sometimes, in order to get higher surface resolution, their altitude will drop to 150 to 160
kilometers while photographing [targets].

# 2. Classification of satellite imaging reconnaissance systems

In accordance with differences in the form of their information transmission, satellite imaging reconnaissance systems
can be divided into two types: return types and transmission types. The reconnaissance information in return-type
reconnaissance systems is stored on film or magnetic tape carriers; after the satellite has completed its reconnaissance
mission, the return capsule in which the information carrier is deposited returns to the surface. The transmission-type
reconnaissance system, on the other hand, is not equipped with a return capsule; the reconnaissance information uses
real-time or extended-time radio transmission methods for transmission to an earth station. In accordance with
differences in their uses, satellite imaging reconnaissance systems can also be divided into two types: general survey
types and detailed survey types. The general survey-type reconnaissance system is equipped with low-resolution
wide-angle cameras; it scans and photographs a defined country or region, and it can find potential military and
economic targets. Detailed survey-type reconnaissance systems use highresolution cameras with fairly narrow fields of
vision; they repeatedly reconnoiter and photograph regions of particular interest that they find during general survey
flights, and they can get clearer photographs. Currently, reconnaissance satellites that are “both general survey and
detailed survey types” have appeared; this kind of satellite has a certain ability to move and change orbit and the
satellite’s lifespan is also fairly long, so it not only can be used for general survey missions, but it also can carry
out detailed survey missions.

3. Sample satellite imaging reconnaissance systems (1) US return-type satellite imaging reconnaissance systems

Fifty-odd years ago, the United States launched the world’s first return-type imaging reconnaissance satellite,
Discoverer 1. Starting in the spring of 1962, the United States’ imaging reconnaissance satellites entered into the
stage of actual applications, and up until now it has developed six generations [of this satellite type]. The first
generation was the Discoverer series, which used visible-light cameras and return film canisters as its form of work; it
had a relatively low resolution (detailed surveys had two to three meters, general surveys had three meters), and its
work life was fairly short. The Discoverer reconnaissance satellite program’s codename was the Corona program, and it
had KH as its serial number. “KH” was an English-language abbreviation for Keyhole, with the meaning of a camera peeping
at the surface as though through a keyhole on the satellite. Therefore, its follow-up models were also directly referred
to as “keyhole” reconnaissance satellites. The photoreconnaissance satellites with differing KH serial numbers used
differing cameras, and their reconnaissance capabilities also differed. The Discoverer satellites were divided into
three types, in accordance with their serial numbers: KH-1, KH-2, and KH-3. The second generation began to be used in
1963; it took shape on the basis of improvements to the first generation, and its performance was somewhat improved. The
third generation began to be used in 1966, as the Samos series. Its detailed survey performance was much greater than
that of the second generation; its orbiting altitude could be lowered to 110 kilometers, and its resolution could reach
about 0.15 meter. The fourth generation began to be used in 1971; it was a type that combined general and detailed
[surveys], and its name was Big Bird. This was a world-famous satellite imaging reconnaissance system, as well as the
last generation of return-type photoreconnaissance satellite; its code name was KH-9. It not only could enter the
atmosphere for surveillance, but it could also carry out “point-blank observation;” it not only could transmit
reconnaissance results by radio, but it also could get information by returning [canisters]. It had a resolution that
could be up to 0.3 meter, but the surface scenery it photographed had a width that was rather small. The Big Bird
reconnaissance satellite could carry a number of film cartridges, its working time in orbit was relatively long, and
every time that war occurred someplace on earth, the United States used [this satellite] to monitor the battlefield. The
sixteenth Big Bird satellite, which was launched in the early 1980s, worked for 261 days in orbit, and it monitored the
battlefield situation of the Iran-Iraq War.

Although return-type photoreconnaissance satellites in the latter period used a number of forms for film cartridges,
still, when all was said and done, it took several days to retrieve, interpret, and process them, while photographs from
detailed surveys required several weeks before they could provide information on the battlefields. This easily bungled
opportunities for battle in high-tech wars, and was unable to satisfy the needs of modern operations, so the United
States later no longer used this type of reconnaissance satellite.

(2) Russia’s return-type satellite photoreconnaissance system

Zenit was the Soviet Union’s return-type satellite photoreconnaissance system in the early period; it was divided into
two models: Zenit-2 and its improved model, Zenit-4. Zenit satellites consisted of two parts: a spherical return
canister and a service module; their exterior appearance was very similar to the Soviet Union’s first-generation manned
spaceship, Vostok. What Russia currently uses is the high-resolution detailed survey-type Antar series of satellite
photoreconnaissance system, including Antar-2K and Antar-4K; of these, the main model is the Antar-4K. The Antar-2K
satellite consists of a composite compartment, an instrument compartment, and a special equipment compartment. The
composite compartment primarily has a propulsion system, while the special equipment compartment has a camera and return
system. The focal length of the camera is more than three meters, its surface resolution is fifty centimeters, and [the
satellite’s] working time in orbit is thirty days. Antar-4K is divided into two models: Antar-4 K 1’s time in orbit has
been extended to forty-five days, while Antar-4 K 2’s time in orbit has been extended to 60 to 114 days, and it has
several film return cartridges.

Russia’s photoreconnaissance satellites all are serialized, and can satisfy reconnaissance requirements for differing
precision and differing periods of time. Zenit-2 was also equipped with electronic reconnaissance devices and had
multi-functional reconnaissance capabilities. The Antar-4 K 2, which had multiple film return cartridges, improved the
time-effectiveness of outer space reconnaissance to a certain extent, and it was possible to select differing models and
differing working times in orbit, based on the mission, thus strengthening flexibility in its uses.

(3) US transmission-type satellite photoreconnaissance systems

The United States’ transmission-type satellite photoreconnaissance systems were developed on the basis of return-type
[systems]; its fifth-generation photoreconnaissance satellite was also its first-generation transmission-type
photoreconnaissance satellite, called Kennan/Crystal, and codenamed KH-11 (that is, Keyhole-11). A total of eight of
this type of satellite were launched, and they have all stopped working. The KH-12 (that is, Keyhole-12) (see Figure
4-1) was the United States’ sixth generation of photoreconnaissance satellite and was also the transmission-type
photoreconnaissance satellite with the world’s highest resolution at that time. It was improved and

manufactured on the basis of the KH-11, and was also called an “advanced Keyhole-11;” it was first launched in August
1989. The KH-12 satellite’s working orbit and exterior were similar to those of the KH-11, its cylindrical structure (or
camera lens) was similar to that of the Hubble space telescope, and its diameter was 4.5 meters; a large rocket engine
was added to its exterior to provide mobility and [the ability] to change orbits; and its total length was more than
fifteen meters (the Hubble telescope was only thirteen meters long). The greatest differences between it and the KH-11
were that it could carry more fuel, it had a greater ability to move and change orbit, and its lifespan was longer. The
KH-12 used digital imaging transmission technology, that is, a satellite-borne analog-to-digital converter transformed
analog signals into digital signals, and these were directly transmitted by a relay satellite to a surface interpreting
center. [There,] they were converted into images and displayed on a large screen; this thus digitized information
transmission, greatly enhanced the time-effectiveness of intelligence collection, and extended the working life of the
satellite. Because the most sophisticated electronic equipment was used, its imaging quality could rival that of
return-type satellites’ photographs, and its resolution was close to ten centimeters. Although the performance of the
KH-11 and KH-12 was advanced, the effectiveness of the visible-light and infrared cameras that they used was not optimal
when the weather was bad (for example, when there were clouds and rain); moreover, the visible-light equipment had no
way to work at night, thus affecting their real-time nature to a certain extent. During the Kosovo Campaign, the KH-11
and KH-12 were affected by the weather a number of times, so that they could not carry out their reconnaissance
missions.

[Image: Missing image]
Figure 4-1: The United States’ KH-12 Imaging Reconnaissance Satellite

In order to make up for the inadequacies of the KH system satellites, in that their reconnaissance effectiveness was
greatly affected by weather conditions, the United

States for the first time, in December 1988, used the space shuttle to launch a Lacrosse synthetic aperture radar
imaging reconnaissance satellite. The Lacrosse satellite is equipped with a fairly large radar antenna and emitter, its
resolution mode is three meters, and its fine sweep mode is one meter. The solar energy battery wings along its two
sides are symmetrically vertical to the satellite’s body; after unfolding, the “wing span” reaches fifty meters, with
power of up to ten to twenty kilowatts, exceeding that of any other satellite. In order to improve the satellite’s
reconnaissance capabilities, the United States’ National Reconnaissance Office also made improvements to it, so that the
resolution of its fine sweep mode has been raised to ten centimeters, almost the same as that of the KH-12. Because the
radar depends upon its own irradiation, that is, it emits electromagnetic waves, therefore no matter whether the weather
is good or bad and no matter whether or not there is sunlight, it can image targets. Moreover, the wavelength of its
radar waves is much longer than the wavelengths of visible light and infrared, so it can “pass through clouds and fog”
and carry out reconnaissance in all weathers and at all times. In particular, it is much more real-time in nature.
During the Gulf War, Lacrosse radar imaging reconnaissance satellites were used to reconnoiter and evaluate the results
of attacks by US cruise missiles and to track the actions of Iraqi armored units. In the Kosovo Campaign, they were used
to reconnoiter weapons and equipment that the Yugoslav military had camouflaged. In these military actions, the Lacrosse
satellite played a very good role.

# II. Satellite electronic reconnaissance systems...81

# 1. Overview

Satellite electronic reconnaissance systems are also called signals intelligence (SIGINT) systems; they refer to
satellite-borne systems that use electronic signals receiving apparatus to analyze radio signals transmitted and
radiated by various targets on land and at sea, to roughly position the signals radiation sources, and to determine
their frequency bands and form of scanning. They are primarily used to acquire the configuration and performance
parameters of enemy early warning and air defense radars, the telemetry data of strategic missile tests, and how
electronic equipment like military radio stations are configured. The frequency reconnaissance scope of satellite
electronic reconnaissance systems is primarily between 30 megahertz and 200 gigahertz, the systems are configured with
many reconnaissance means, and their work forms are also flexible and variable. They no longer detect radio signals in
the simple sense [of the term]; for example, they combine visible light and infrared imaging reconnaissance devices to
reconnoiter targets, and they form a network with multiple satellites for their work. These have all greatly improved
the working capabilities of satellite electronic reconnaissance systems. The effective payload of satellite electronic
reconnaissance systems consists of the detection and receiving antennas, receiver system, recording system, information
processing system, communications system, propellant receptacle, and orbit and attitude control system. After a
satellite electronic reconnaissance system detects and receives signals, it records and stores them and does initial
processing; afterwards, it sends the reconnaissance data through a downlink communications link to the earth station for
further processing and distribution.

Electronic reconnaissance satellites ordinarily operate in near-circular orbits at altitudes of 300 kilometers to 1,000
kilometers, with a period of about 90 to 105 minutes. At these altitudes, satellite antennas cover a large area, they
have a broad reconnaissance scope, their duration lasts for long periods of time, they can pass through the air over a
single point for more than ten minutes, and they are superior to and more secure than other means of electronic
reconnaissance. As electronic intelligence relies more and more on satellites, electronic devices have continually
improved, especially in the United States, and the height of electronic reconnaissance satellites’ orbits has already
developed to altitudes of more than 800 kilometers. The higher the location of a satellite, the broader the area of land
it will cover. If [satellites] are placed in geostationary orbits, only three satellites are required to cover the
entire globe; this greatly enhances the timeeffectiveness for monitoring electronic targets. At the same time, in order
to improve the time resolution and space resolution, the form in which satellite electronic reconnaissance systems work
has developed from a single satellite working [by itself] to a network made up of multiple satellites. In order to
improve the timeliness of information, information processing functions, which previously were on the ground, have
incrementally developed toward satellites, and with the development and application of large-scale integrated and
microprocessing technology, terminal equipment on satellites will shoulder more and more of the information processing
tasks; this will lay the foundation for direct use of satellites to transmit information on future battlefields.

In May 1962, the United States launched the first detailed survey-type electronic reconnaissance satellite; following
this, it also launched a general survey-type electronic reconnaissance satellite. In the early 1970s, after the United
States had determined the basic deployment of its opponent’s electromagnetic radiation sources, it no longer launched
detailed survey-type electronic reconnaissance satellites, and as the life of satellites grew and as electronic
reconnaissance technology progressed, the number of launches of general survey-type satellites also was greatly reduced.
After 1971, United States launched the high elliptical orbit-type Jumpseat electronic reconnaissance satellite and the
geosynchronous orbit-type Rhyolite electronic reconnaissance satellite, one after the other, as well as its follow-up
Magnum electronic reconnaissance satellite. Currently, the US satellite electronic reconnaissance system has developed a
total of six types, and what it is now using is general survey types, synchronous types, high elliptical orbit

types, and new types of extreme orbit types. During the Gulf War, the United States’ satellite electronic reconnaissance
system listened in on and reconnoitered Iraq’s radio and microwave communication day and night, as well as the telemetry
signals [Iraq] was testing; after this electronic intelligence was transmitted to the National Security Agency for
processing and analysis, the Iraqi military’s assemblies and movements, the locations and functional parameters of its
military radars and radio stations, and information about new types of weapons and equipment were derived from it.

Because the lifespan of Russia’s electronic reconnaissance satellites was relatively short, [Russia] launched fairly
large numbers of these. Russian electronic reconnaissance satellites can roughly be divided into four generations, and
currently the third and fourth generations predominate. Of these, the fourth generation is one of several types of
satellites that Russia has researched, developed, and launched, whose structure is the most complex and whose
manufacturing is the most expensive. Its primary mission is to intercept communications and electronic signals, and to
track the ship activities of the United States and NATO. The satellite has fairly strong satellite-borne processing
abilities, and can relay data in real-time to earth stations within Russia, using Potok satellites in geosynchronous
orbit.

2. Categories of satellite electronic reconnaissance systems

Just like satellite photoreconnaissance systems, satellite electronic reconnaissance systems are divided into two types
– general survey models and detailed survey models – and they can operate in a number of types of orbits. Satellites
operating in nearly circular orbits at altitudes of 300 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers have periods of 90 to 105
minutes; their antennas cover large areas, their scope of reconnaissance is broad, their duration lasts for fairly long
periods of time, they pass through the air above a single area for more than ten minutes, and they are primarily used
for general surveys. Satellites that operate in high elliptical orbits pass through the air over a given area for up to
ten hours and can carry out prolonged monitoring of this area. This makes detailed surveys easy; that is, they
accurately confirm targets of interest discovered during the process of a general survey, and they obtain the
characteristics and specific parameters of radio station and radar signals, which makes it easy to derive valuable
intelligence. And with electronic reconnaissance satellites moving in geostationary orbit, only three can then cover the
entire earth; if they are used together with electronic reconnaissance satellites in other orbits, it is possible to
form a system with a number of functions, such as general surveys and detailed surveys.

3. Typical satellite electronic reconnaissance systems (1) The United States’ Jumpseat electronic reconnaissance
satellite

The Jumpseat is a first-generation electronic reconnaissance satellite that the United Sates began launching in the
1970s; the number that was launched was fairly large, and now there are still two of them working in orbit. The Jumpseat
satellite uses a high elliptical orbit with a period of twelve hours and an angle of inclination of 63.4 degrees; its
apogee is at an altitude of 37,000 kilometers, similar to the orbit of Russia’s Molniya satellite, and it can carry out
long-term surveillance of key areas in Russia (particularly of its northern parts). It is primarily used to reconnoiter
military radio station and radar signals. Two to three of these satellites work in a network, that is, they can carry
out continuous reconnaissance at all times and in all weathers. They use such advanced technologies as large antenna
structures and satellite-borne information processing, they have fairly high reconnaissance precision and
satellite-borne data processing capabilities, and they can quickly identify and transmit target information. The weight
of the upgraded model of Jumpseat satellite was increased from the original 680 kilograms to about 8,000 kilograms, the
diameter of the parabolic receiving antenna was 18.3 meters, while the parabolic downlink communications antenna had a
diameter of 3.05 meters. The newest Jumpseat satellite, on the other hand, uses a broadband phased array eavesdropping
antenna; after this deploys, it has a diameter of up to 91.4 meters and can simultaneously listen in on up to a thousand
ground signal sources.

(2) The United States’ Magnum electronic reconnaissance satellite

The Magnum is a new type of US geostationary electronic reconnaissance satellite, as well as the main force in the
United States’ current space electronic reconnaissance system; there currently are three operating in orbit, and they
can cover the entire globe. After the satellite-borne reconnaissance system on the Magnum satellite listens in on
signals, these undergo simple processing on the satellite; they then are first sent to a US military ground base
situated in Australia, and they are then sent back to the US homeland. The Magnum satellite carries two antennas: the
forward-facing parabolic antenna’s maximum diameter is 152.5 meters, and it is used to intercept all radio signals from
0.1 gigahertz to 20 gigahertz, including radar signals, missile telemetry and remote control signals, radio station
communications signals, and microwave signals; the rearfacing antenna is used to forward signals to the ground. The
Magnum satellite is designed to have a long lifespan, and the signals processing capabilities on the satellite are quite
strong; they can carry out real-time and continuous reconnaissance and listening.

(3) Russia’s Tselina electronic reconnaissance satellite

Russia started using Cosmos-3M rockets to launch Tselina satellites at the end of the 1960s. Most of these satellites
operated at an orbit 540 kilometers high, with an inclination of seventy-four degrees; they used the gravity gradient
stabilization method. Although a fairly large number of types of electronic reconnaissance satellites were launched
during the time of the Soviet Union, Russia currently only uses two of these, that is, the Tselina-D and the Tselina-2.
The Tselina-2 electronic reconnaissance satellite began to be used in 1990 and it currently is still being launched,
with one to two satellites launched yearly on average. The Tselina satellite uses the form of a number of satellites
intersecting to form a network, with low earth orbits. Their probes are very flexible and their monitoring capabilities
are strong, but the number of satellites that are needed is large. The satellite structure is simple and easy to
control, and its directional capabilities are strong.

# III. Satellite missile early warning and nuclear explosion detection systems...84

1. Satellite early warning and detection systems

Satellite missile early warning systems refer to satellite-borne systems that use infrared probes on satellites in order
to monitor, find, and track strategic ballistic missiles launched by specific targets and to issue early warnings.
Satellites that are loaded with this kind of system usually are deployed in geostationary orbit or in high elliptical
orbits with a period of about twelve hours, and they generally work in networks with multiple satellites. Missile early
warning satellite networks normally network with space-based probe networks and ground early warning radar networks in
order to form early warning and detections platforms that integrate the land, sea, air, and space, striving to find
[missiles] in a timely manner and trying to track enemy-launched ballistic missiles and space flight vehicles throughout
the entire process of the boost phase, flight phase, and reentry phase, in order to provide air defense anti-missile
operations with necessary early warning time and interception parameters. Early warning satellites have high orbits,
cover a broad scope, and are able to overcome the drawbacks that ground air defense radars have, where they are unable
to find targets as early as possible because electronic wave signals spread along straight lines and are affected by the
earth’s curvature. Based on the distance of the opponent’s missile launch site, [missile early warning satellites] can
give fifteen to thirty minutes of early warning time, and thus make it easy for your own side to catch opportunities for
battle and to organize strategic defense or carry out a counterattack in a timely manner. Some countries also have X-ray
probes, gamma ray probes, and neutron counters on their early warning satellites, in order to also carry out the task of
detecting nuclear explosions.

2. Satellite nuclear explosion detection systems

Satellite nuclear explosion detection systems refer to satellite reconnaissance systems that are used to monitor and
detect nuclear explosions in the atmosphere and in outer space. In peacetime, this system is primarily used to monitor
how the various countries are implementing the [Comprehensive] Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; in wartime, they are used to
collect the parameters of nuclear explosions, such as the nuclear explosions’ coordinates, time, power, and altitude
data, in order to appraise the effects of the nuclear explosion. Satellite nuclear explosion detection systems have
advantages in that there is little background interference and the distance of detection is long, and they can detect
the Xrays, gamma rays, neutrons, electromagnetic pulses, and nuclear explosion fireballs that are produced alongside
nuclear explosions. The Vela nuclear explosion detection satellite system that the United States first launched in the
early 1960s adopted the paired launch form, and [these satellites] operated in a nearly circular orbit at an altitude of
90,000 to 120,000 kilometers, with an inclination of 320 degrees to 40 degrees and a period of 85 to 112 hours; they
were designed to have a lifespan of three years. By the early 1970s, a total of six had been launched; afterwards, this
kind of special satellite was no longer launched. Instead, nuclear explosion probes with similar functions were
installed in early warning satellites or navigation satellites, in order to also carry out the task of detecting nuclear
explosions.

3. Typical missile early warning and nuclear explosion detection systems (1) The United States’ Defense Support Program
satellite system

The Defense Support Program was a program that the US Air Force designed in the late 1960s that used satellites to carry
out missile early warning. The Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite system could provide twenty-four hours [daily] of
global monitoring, and was used to detect ballistic missile launches and nuclear explosions. The US Air Force’s DSP
early warning satellite network was composed of five satellites in geostationary orbit, consisting of three working
satellites and two backup satellites. This system usually could provide a total of twenty to thirty minutes of early
warning time against intercontinental ballistic missiles, five to ten minutes of early warning time against
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and five minutes of early warning time against tactical ballistic missiles. A new
generation of DSP satellite systems has a very high level of automation, its abilities to change orbits and move are
markedly increased, and it has a certain ability to prevent collisions. At the same time, it also has data
retransmission functions; that is, after enemy jamming or data relay, it can quickly repeat its transmissions. Moreover,
it can use satellite-borne laser transmission links to transmit data to other satellites, ensuring that the ground
reliably receives them.

Starting in the 1970s, DSP early warning satellites became a component part of the United States’ North American Air
Defense Command (NORAD) tactical early warning and offensive evaluation system. The data downlinked from early warning
satellites were transmitted to NORAD via communications links and to the Space Command’s early warning center for
processing; the processed data were directly delivered to various bureaus and distributed among the various areas of
operations throughout the globe. The United States’ overseas units or allies could also directly receive DSP satellites’
data through the Joint Tactical Ground Stations (JTAGS). In the Gulf War, the United States’ DSP satellite system played
an important role in Patriot missiles’ interception of Scud missiles. However, DSP satellites themselves also have weak
points; for example, their satellite scanning speed is slow, their ability to identify targets is poor, they have
problems with false alarms, and their ability to detect theater of war missiles is quite limited. Therefore, the United
States decided to research and develop a new type of Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) with stronger deployment
capabilities, in order to replace the DSP system

(2) The United States’ Space-Based Infrared System

In the early 1990s, the United States began to research and develop a new generation of missile early warning satellite,
under the Space-Based Infrared System. The Space-Based Infrared System was a comprehensive system that included a number
of satellite constellations and ground installations, composed of high-orbit satellites, low-orbit satellites, and
ground installations. The high-orbit part of the Space-Based Infrared System will provide US supreme command authorities
and operations departments with infrared data related to the launch, boost, and flight phases and landing point regions
of global and theater of war missiles or other infrared incidents. The high-orbiting satellites include four
geosynchronous satellites (GEO) and two high-elliptical orbit satellites (HEO). The scanning speed and flexibility of
the high orbit satellites of the Space-Based Infrared System are greater than those of the DSP satellites, and they can
transmit early warning information to ground units ten to twenty seconds after a missile launch. The geosynchronous
satellites are primarily used to detect and find ballistic missiles in the boost phase; they have two types of infrared
probes: staring and scanning. The scanning probe uses a small-scale phased array to scan the entire region in order to
construct a complete image of the entire region. The low-orbit part is made up of four to twelve lowearth orbit
satellites (SBIRS-LEO). The low-orbit satellites’ missions primarily are to provide precision tracking and
identification in the trajectory’s mid-flight phase; they will track ballistic missiles world-wide, from their launch to
their reentry, and will provide guidance data to missile interception missiles. The low-orbit satellites and high-orbit
satellites jointly provide the ability to cover the entire world. The SBIRS system not only can complete its strategic
missile early warning mission better than the DSP system was able to, but it also can carry out effective early warning
and tracking against attacks by tactical ballistic missiles, and it thus can meet the needs of the US military in the $2
1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century for early warning against strategic and tactical ballistic missiles.

# IV. Satellite cartographic systems...87

# 1. Overview

Satellite cartographic systems are also called satellite geodetic and mapping systems; they refer to satellite geodetic
systems that are used to determine the shape of the earth, the distribution of the earth’s gravity field and geomagnetic
field, and the precise geographic coordinates of various points on the earth’s surface, as well as such geophysical
information as movements of the earth’s tectonic plates and polar motion. They are the main component part of geodetic
survey systems. Because the distribution of the earth’s gravity field is not uniform and because of errors in
measurement, the various geographic locations shown on existing maps often do not correspond with actual sites; it is
possible, by means of geodetic satellites, to calibrate errors in data related to calculations for missile trajectories,
[related to] inertial guidance for aircraft and missiles, and [related to] matching cruise missiles’ guidance to maps,
thus improving the accuracy of hits and greatly enhancing the operational effectiveness of strategic weapons. Geodetic
satellites have value militarily in their broad-ranging applications, and the US and Russian geodetic satellites are
launched especially for military use. In addition, it is possible to equip geodetic satellites with other special
equipment (such as multispectral cameras), in order to survey earth resources, thus turning them into earth resources
satellites, to be used in ascertaining and getting a grasp on the reserves of the various nations’ strategic resources.

Currently, the nations that have launched satellites especially for geodesy consist of the United States, Russia, and
France. Of these, the United States’ geodetic satellites consist of Geos-3, the Laser Geodynamics Satellite and others;
Russia’s geodetic satellites are mixed in with its Cosmos series; and France’s geodetic satellites consist of the
Diaposon, Diadem, Peole, and others. The US Department of Defense in February 2000 carried out three-dimensional, highly
accurate digital terrain mapping of seventy percent of the entire globe’s land area, using a synthetic aperture radar
carried on the space shuttle; these data have an important value militarily and especially for precision-guided weapons.

2. Categories of satellite cartographic systems

In accordance with whether or not a satellite carries special active geodetic systems, satellite geodetic systems can be
divided into two types: active and passive. Currently, most are active geodetic-type satellites. In accordance with the
differing geodetic missions and methods, satellite geodetic systems can also be divided into geometric satellite
geodetic systems and dynamic satellite geodetic systems. Satellite geometric geodesy uses satellites as reference points
or control points to engage in geodetic surveys. Based on the role of satellites in geodesy, satellite geometric geodesy
can also be divided into two types. The first is data for precision predictions of satellite orbits, using the
satellites as positioning benchmarks, in order to determine the precise coordinates of anchor points. By using this
method, navigation satellites and reconnaissance satellites can also serve as geodetic satellites; their accuracy is
determined by the accuracy of predictions about the satellites’ orbits. The second is to treat satellites as
intermediary control points for the various observation stations, and to carry out trans-continental and transoceanic
global geodetic conjunction through simultaneous observations and spatial triangulation, in accordance with unified
global geodetic data, in order to build a highprecision global network of geodetic control points. Satellite dynamic
geodesy uses already-known satellite orbital parameter or the instantaneous positions of satellites to obtain the
earth’s gravity parameters, based on orbital perturbation theory, and to thus determine the geocentric coordinates of
the locations of observation points.

3. Typical satellite cartographic systems (1) The United States’ Anna satellite geodetic system

The US Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration cooperated in 1962 to launch the first
geodetic satellite, the Anna-1B. The Anna-1B’s effective payload consisted of a mapping camera, electronic ranging, and
a Doppler tachometer. In consideration that the Anna-1B would be equipped with a laser ranging system, the US Army
developed a Sequential Collation of Range (SECOR) transponder for the ANNA-1B in orbit. A ground-transmitted phase
modulated signal would be received in the SECOR transponder installed on the ANNA-1B, and then sent back to earth. The
ANNA-1B could transmit continuous wave signals to the surface on unmodulated fixed frequencies, and the continuous wave
signals received on the surface would produce a shift in the frequency (the Doppler effect). The size of the frequency
shift was compared to the rate of change in the oblique distance between the earth station and the satellite, that is,
the radial velocity. By installing a laser rangefinder on a telescope on the surface, this could be used to
simultaneously measure angles and distances.

(2) The United States’ Laser Geodynamics Satellite Geodetic system

A total of two of the United States’ Laser Geodynamics satellites were launched. The satellite was a sphere made of
aluminum; it was sixty centimeters in diameter and weighed 410 kilograms, and it used a circular orbit. One [of the
satellites] had an altitude of 5,800 kilometers, with an inclination of 110 degrees; the other had an altitude of 5,843
kilometers, with an inclination of fifty-two degrees. The surface of the satellite had 426 laser mirrors, used to verify
the laser satellite’s tracking technology, and to accurately measure the movement of the earth’s crust and its ability
to move in a rotating manner; it measured fault movements, the scope of local changes, tectonic plate movement, the
rotation of the earth, terrestrial tides, and the location of observation points; and it carried out precise global
measurements, thus establishing a fairly precise system of geocoordinates.

# V. Satellite maritime surveillance systems...88

# 1. Overview

Satellite maritime surveillance systems refer to satellite-borne reconnaissance systems that can do real-time or
near-real-time surveillance, listen in on shipborne radar signals and radio communications signals, and be used to
detect and monitor the activities of ships and submarines at sea. Satellite maritime reconnaissance systems can monitor
the ocean’s surface in all weather conditions, such as dark nights and clouds; they can differentiate enemy ship
formations and the direction and speed of their sailing, in an effective manner; they can detect missile nuclear
submarines that are submerged underwater and track cruise missiles that are flying at low altitudes; they can provide
important intelligence for launching anti-ship missiles or other weapons to destroy enemy ships; and they can also
provide important data such as sea surface conditions and maritime characteristics such as the speed of ocean currents,
the temperature of seawater, sea surface wind speeds, the height of sea level, and dangerous objects in shallow waters,
[in order to ensure] safe sailing by their own country’s ships.

Because sea areas are broad and [because] the targets being probed are mostly in the midst of dynamic changes, the
orbits in which satellites move are all fairly high; they usually use near-circular orbits at altitudes of around 1,000
kilometers and with inclinations of sixty-three degrees (the critical inclination). In order to be able to carry out
continuous monitoring of the broad oceans, it is generally necessary to have multiple satellites form a network of
surveillance satellites, in order to achieve the goals of continuous surveillance, increased probability of detection,
and precise location.

2. The classifications of satellite maritime surveillance systems

Satellite maritime surveillance systems can be divided into electronic reconnaissancetype satellite maritime
surveillance systems and radar-type satellite maritime surveillance systems, in accordance with differences in the
reconnaissance and surveillance equipment that they have and the differences in the reconnaissance means that they
employ. The former are also called passive-type satellite maritime surveillance systems and the latter are also called
active-type satellite maritime surveillance systems; the two work in cooperation and coordination with each other.
Passive-type satellite maritime surveillance systems use electronic reconnaissance equipment to intercept radio
communications and radar signals that are emitted by targets on the ocean surface, in order to determine target
locations, or they use millimeter wave radiometers and infrared scanners to probe submerged nuclear submarines.
Active-type satellite maritime surveillance systems, on the other hand, are used to provide intelligence such as ship
dimensions. Because activetype maritime surveillance satellites have nuclear power sources on the satellites, they are
also called nuclear-powered maritime surveillance satellites; the satellites generally have high-powered,
large-aperture, nuclear-powered radar, and by emitting radar wave pulses against the ocean surface, they scan and
collect echo signals reflected from the target.

3. Typical satellite maritime surveillance systems (1) The United States’ White Cloud maritime surveillance satellites

White Cloud was a US electronic reconnaissance-type maritime surveillance satellite, which was also called the Naval
Ocean Surveillance System (NOSS). Its primary mission was to judge the quality, position, speed, and direction of
targets, through intercepting the radar, radio, and other communications signals of ships on the ocean and of underwater
submarines, in order to track and locate targets and to transmit the location information at set times to naval ships.
White Cloud satellites were the main force in the United States’ space maritime surveillance.

White Cloud satellites used a mother satellite structure; after the main satellite (the mother satellite) entered orbit,
it shot out three sub-satellites, with a gap between them of several dozen kilometers, that is, each group had four
satellites. The White Cloud system generally worked as a cluster made up of four groups, for a total of sixteen
satellites, in order to carry out surveillance and location. The newest type of White Cloud used a means whereby four
satellites (one main and three sub-satellites) were launched together; onboard the satellites were large numbers of
advanced devices, such as passive radiofrequency receivers, omni-directional electronic information antenna arrays,
multipassband filters, multiplier detectors, and data forwarding devices. The satellites operated in medium and low
orbits, and every group of satellites could monitor signals within a scope of 7,000 kilometers. Every group of three
sub-satellites formed a triangular configuration for its work, it used the principle of time differences in receiving
information to do its locating, and after the location information was processed by the main satellite, it was
transmitted back to the surface. A certain distance was maintained between each group, and they assisted one another in
their work. The White Cloud satellites orbited at an inclination of 63.4 degrees, and they could monitor all maritime
areas between 63.4 degrees south latitude to 63.4 degrees north latitude. The four groups of satellites in a
constellation alternated in monitoring the same maritime area, and they repeated it more than thirty times a day, so
they had the ability for continuous surveillance. The information that the satellites obtained, after processing by the
main satellite, could be promptly transmitted back to the surface and to ships at sea. The main satellite had four
transmitters, three of which were used to transmit reconnaissance data, so it was possible to carry out real-time or
near-real-time surveillance.

White Cloud satellites came into widespread use in a number of local wars. In the BritishArgentine Falkland Islands War,
they provided the British fleet with intelligence on the Argentine navy’s ships. In the Gulf War, they intercepted radio
and radar signals emitted by Iraqi ships, to determine [the ships’] position, direction, and speed, and continuously
tracked them, while at the same time pointing out targets for the multinational force to attack at sea, with excellent
results. During the Kosovo Campaign, they surveilled the activities at sea of Yugoslav and Russian ships; this prevented
naval assistance that Russia could have provided to Yugoslavia.

(2) Russia’s maritime surveillance satellites

The working orbit of Russia’s maritime surveillance satellites is fairly low, and the orbital inclination is high; they
can monitor broad sea areas between sixty-five degrees south latitude to sixty-five degrees north latitude. They are
divided into two types: the electronic reconnaissance type and the radar reconnaissance type. Russia’s electronic
maritime surveillance satellites are all located in a nearly circular orbit of 450 kilometers, with an inclination of
sixty-five degrees; they weigh 4,000 kilograms and have a lifespan of eight to twelve months. The satellites have
passive-type electronic receivers, with frequencies of 166 megahertz; they determine the location of surface ships and
monitor the ships’ activities by probing their communications and radar signals. The satellites also can probe
shore-based radar and communications signals, in order to ascertain how the shore-based radars are deployed. Currently,
one to two satellites are launched each year, on average. Russian radar maritime surveillance satellites use active
forms for their work; they use satellite-borne radars to probe and monitor the activities of ships at sea, and they send
back to earth stations the information they have reconnoitered, thus determining the location, direction, and speed of
ships. The satellites are cylindrical in shape, about 7.8 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.8 meters, weighing around
4,500 kilograms, with an orbital altitude of 250 kilometers and an inclination of sixty-five degrees. They use
nuclear-powered equipment, thus meeting the needs of their high-powered radars, and they have a strong probe capability.
During the Falkland Islands War, the Argentine navy’s Super Etendard attack aircraft used Exocet air-to-ship missiles to
sink the British Navy’s missile destroyer Sheffield. According to reports, the position of the British warship was
reported to the Argentine navy by the Soviet Union, after this had been obtained by maritime surveillance satellites.
However, there are risks with this kind of satellite, and the Soviet Union had incidents where nuclear-powered
satellites crashed.

(3) The US Navy’s Space-Based Wide Area Surveillance System (SBWASS)

In the early 1990s, the United States replaced the Navy maritime surveillance system White Cloud with the Navy’s
Space-Based Wide Area Surveillance System (SBWASS– Navy) Ranger. At the same time as this, the US Air Force also was
developing a SpaceBased Wide Area Surveillance System (SBWASS–Air Army), primarily for monitoring aircraft. The Ranger
SBWASS–Navy had three satellites in each cluster, predominantly using infrared imaging. A total of four of these were
successfully launched, with the last one, on 12 May 1996, using an Atlas-4 to launch a cluster of three satellites. The
perigee altitudes were respectively 1,050 kilometers, 1,050 kilometers, and 1,053 kilometers, while the apogee altitudes
were respectively 1,166 kilometers, 1,160 kilometers, and 1,163 kilometers, with an orbital inclination of 63.4 degrees.
The US Air Force’s SBWASS – Air Army was a radar imaging satellite; inside it was a synthetic aperture radar and
electronic reconnaissance equipment. Two of them were successfully launched, the last one using an Atlas-2 for a 25
April 1992 launch. The perigee altitude was 784 kilometers, while the apogee altitude was 805 kilometers, with an
orbital inclination of 85.14 degrees.

Covering the globe required a number of clusters or a number of satellites, regardless of whether it was the Navy’s
Ranger SBWASS–Navy or the Air Force’s SBWASS – Air Army; these were constructed in a duplicate manner, and the expenses
were huge. Therefore, the US Department of Defense decided in the early 1990s not to separately construct the Navy’s and
the Air Force’s Space-Based Wide Area Surveillance Systems, but to have the Department of Defense construct a
Space-Based Wide Area Surveillance System–Consolidated in a unified manner, and it considered having space-based radar
results be used in a system, so that the SBWASS–Consolidated became a component part of a space-based radar system.

# VI. Satellite meteorological monitoring and forecasting systems...91

# 1. Overview

Satellite meteorological monitoring and forecasting systems refer to satellite-borne systems that obtain military
meteorological situations from space and that provide ground force, naval, and air force operations with real-time
meteorological materials for strategic regions on a global scale, as well as for the air above any battlefield. They
usually consist of special systems for monitoring and of support systems. The special systems are the effective payload
of the meteorological satellites, while the support systems support the satellite’s normal work. Satellite
meteorological monitoring and forecasting systems have various types of scanning radiometers, visible light and infrared
television cameras, temperature and humidity probes, and automated image transmission devices. After computer
processing, these devices change the various meteorological data that have been collected into photographic images or
transform them into electrical signals, and record them on magnetic tape; afterwards, [this tape] is sent back to the
surface. After meteorological personnel on the surface carry out comprehensive analysis of the meteorological materials
that have been collected through the satellites, in combination with meteorological materials that have been obtained by
other methods, they can accurately predict the weather. Military satellite meteorological and forecasting systems have
the features of strong encryption and high imaging resolution; when used together with photoreconnaissance satellite
systems, they can more effectively get clear photographs of important military targets, and the data they obtain can
also be used to correct other satellites’ orbital measurements and the trajectories of intercontinental missiles, thus
improving the accuracy of satellites’ measurements of orbits and strikes by missiles.

Because meteorological satellites have very high social and economic benefits as well as military benefits, they have
developed quite quickly; currently, the breadth of their applications is second only to that of communications
satellites. Internationally, a world meteorological satellites organization7 has also been established, allowing the
various countries to share meteorological satellite information resources. The United States, Russia, China, the
European Union, and Japan all have their own meteorological satellites. Of these, the United States, Russia, and China
are countries that simultaneously have two types of meteorological satellites: geostationary and sun-synchronous
[satellites]. Some countries, such as the United States and Russia, in order to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and
confidentiality of their forecasting, also have especially launched military meteorological satellites.

Since the United States launched Tyros-1, the first meteorological satellites, in 1960, many types of meteorological
satellites have been launched in the world. Up until now, the United States and Russia (including the Soviet Union) have
launched more than 100 meteorological satellites. The US Department of Defense began to research and develop special
military meteorological satellites in the 1960s. These satellites were polar orbiting meteorological satellites; they
went through numerous upgrades, and have developed from Block 4A, 4B, SA, SB, and SC into Block SD-1 and 5L-2 [sic]. Of
these, the Block SD-2 was the most advanced. The Block SI-2 [sic] is an upgraded model; it is characterized by a long
lifespan of use and great flexibility. The satellite not only has microwave temperature probes, microwave imagers,
atmospheric density probes, and multispectral infrared probes, but it also has redundant sensors, new forms of sensors,
and an expanded sensor area.

2. Classifications of satellite meteorological monitoring and forecasting systems

Based on differences in satellites’ orbits, satellite meteorological monitoring and forecasting systems can be divided
into two types: polar orbiting types and synchronousorbiting types. The two types of satellite systems mostly combine
military and civilian uses, but there are also meteorological satellite systems that are especially for military use,
and they generally operate in networks of several satellites. Meteorological satellites can be divided into two types,
in accordance with where their orbits are: sun-synchronous orbiting meteorological satellites (or polar orbiting
meteorological satellites) and geostationary meteorological satellites. Sun-synchronous orbiting meteorological
satellites patrol the surface of the globe twice each day and can obtain global meteorological materials; they can thus
repeatedly compare meteorological materials for the same area. Geostationary meteorological satellites operate in space
above the equator, and can cover close to one-third of the globe’s area. They can carry out continuous monitoring of the
same area, and send data back to the surface in real-time. By evenly spacing four of this kind of satellite, they can
continuously monitor the formation and development of weather situations for the entire globe and for low-latitude
regions, but their ability for meteorological monitoring in regions at latitudes higher than fifty-five degrees is
somewhat lacking. These two types of meteorological satellites supplement each other and can get complete global
meteorological materials. In accordance with their uses, meteorological satellites can be divided into civilian
meteorological satellites, military meteorological satellites, and combined military-civilian meteorological satellites.
Civilian meteorological satellites primarily are used in meteorological forecasting, in order to support the building of
the national economy. Military

meteorological satellites collect meteorological information, globally or for a specific region, and forecast weather
situations, in accordance with special needs militarily; they are characterized by strong encryption and high image
resolution, they can provide realtime meteorological materials for the various global strategic regions, battlefields,
and the various services and service arms, and they provide necessary meteorological support for drafting military plans
of action. Combined military-civilian meteorological satellites not only can be used by the military, but also by
civilians.

3. Typical satellite meteorological monitoring and forecasting systems (1) China’s Fengyun meteorological satellites

China has successfully researched and developed the Fengyun series of meteorological satellites; this includes two types
of satellite: stationary-orbiting and polar orbiting. These two types of satellite comprise China’s meteorological
satellite operational monitoring system, and have already entered into a stable phase of business operations. They
continuously gather information about the world’s atmospheric environment, and play an important role in such areas as
weather forecasting, climate predictions, and weather studies. In particular, they have conspicuously enhanced the
time-effectiveness and accuracy of weather forecasting. The second-generation polar orbiting meteorological satellites
(Fengyun-3) have been successfully launched and are operating in orbit, and research and development is currently
underway for the second generation of stationary orbit meteorological satellites (Fengyun-4). The Fengyun-2A (FY-2A)
that was launched on 10 June 1997 was China’s first geostationary meteorological satellite. It operates together with
Fengyun-1, and ended the history where China’s meteorological forecasting for a long time depended upon foreign
meteorological satellites, turning China into the third country, after the United States and Russia, to simultaneously
have two series of meteorological satellites: polar orbiting and geostationary orbiting. This provided technological
support for China to participate in international cooperation and meteorological information exchanges and to carry out
studies on global climate change. On 25 June 2000, China launched the Fengyun-2B (FY-2B), which is its second
geostationary meteorological satellite. This satellite has a number of communications scanning radiometers, which could
get three types of meteorological cloud maps – visible-light, infrared, and water conditions – and can get observational
data from meteorological, maritime, and hydrological data collection platforms distributed over a broad area. It can
also broadcast materials for widened digital images broadcasts, lowresolution cloud broadcasts, and S-waveband weather
map broadcasts, and can collect and send back monitoring data on the space environment. However, the radiometer can only
align with the earth half of the time, and the utilization of its cloud maps is relatively low.

(2) The United States’ Defense Meteorological Satellite

The full name of the United States’ Defense Meteorological Satellite is the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
(DMSP). Under ordinary conditions, this system has two satellites positioned in the same orbit; as the satellites travel
around the earth in their orbit, they can cover and scan the surface of the earth 2,965 kilometers wide every circuit;
in twelve hours they can cover the entire globe once. The selection of this orbit can allow the satellites to provide
military departments with cloud maps and meteorological materials twice each day for a specific region. The new
generation of Defense Meteorological Satellites can carry out global observations under all weathers and at all times,
and the resolution of their materials is high. The visible-light systems imaging capabilities on the satellites are
quite strong, and various types of measuring devices, such as infrared and microwave, can provide comprehensive
meteorological materials with fairly high resolution. Because they are military meteorological satellites, they use
encrypted communications; only the US military can use the materials. During the Gulf War, the US military had three
Defense Meteorological Satellites providing services, and six terminal stations were set up in the theater of war to
receive meteorological materials. The US military used the data from the Defense Meteorological Satellites to forecast
the rapidly changing weather situation and to monitor the situation of oil wells’ burning. In its drafting of plans for
air raids, [the US military] also used meteorological information to deduce wind directions and to determine whether or
not it was possible [for Iraq] to spread chemical warfare agents, and to issue sandstorm and other weather alerts to the
multinational force. The multinational force’s use of the newest meteorological data fully brought into play the
functions of infrared and nightvision sighting devices. In the process of drafting plans of operations, preparing
weapons systems, preparing defenses, and maneuvering units, meteorological satellites could also provide important
support. Because fogs and sandstorms in desert regions along the coast could reduce visibility to zero, meteorological
data was even more important in these coastal desert regions. The selection of targets for attack and the types of
aircraft and ammunition also required meteorological data.

(3) Russia’s Meteor meteorological satellite

The Meteor meteorological satellite was a type of combined military-civilian meteorological satellite that the Soviet
Union developed on the basis of its Cosmos meteorological satellites; its satellite-borne probes primarily consisted of
visible-light cameras that were used to monitor cloud- and snow-covered conditions, infrared television cameras that
were used to monitor how clouds and snow were distributed, and scanning radiometers that were used to collect solar
radiation data reflected from the earth. The Meteor-2 model was equipped with a visible light/infrared scanning

radiometer, a vertical temperature probe, and automated image transmission equipment, as well as two multispectral
scanners of an experimental nature. The first Meteor meteorological satellite was launched on 23 March 1969. Currently,
the polar orbiting meteorological satellite that Russia uses is still the Meteor series, but after 1995 it also had a
new Meteor-3 type. The Meteor meteorological satellite uses a non-sunsynchronous nearly circular quasi-polar orbit, but
the altitudes of the three types of satellites are not quite the same: the Meteor-1 [altitude] is 600 kilometers, the
Meteor-2 [altitude] is 900 kilometers, and the Meteor-3 [altitude] is 1,230 kilometers.

The early-period Meteor meteorological satellites recorded the images they photographed on magnetic tape, and then
returned them to the surface based on commands from the surface. The later-period satellites use the form of automated
imaging transmission; they not only can transmit images in real-time, but can also store images on the satellite and
then later send them back to the surface in playback form, based on commands from the surface. The uniqueness of the
Meteor meteorological satellite is that it is equipped with eight to twelve micrometer infrared cameras and
multispectral probes, and therefore can also be used as a resources satellite. In addition, it is also equipped with
fairly advanced synthetic aperture radars and other microwave remote sensors. Because [Russia] is situated in areas with
high latitudes, it mainly relies upon data provided by polar orbiting meteorological satellites.

# VII. Satellite earth resources surveying systems...95

Satellite earth resources surveying systems refer to civilian satellites that are used to survey and study earth
resources but that also have very great military value. Earth resources satellites can carry multispectral remote
sensing devices, in order to capture multispectral electromagnetic information radiated and reflected by surface
targets, and send this information to ground collection stations. The ground stations process and interpret this
information, based on the spectral characteristics of the various materials that they have gotten a grasp on in advance,
and they thus receive information on the characteristics, distribution, and state of the various resources. Earth
resources satellites can be divided into land resources satellites and maritime resources satellites. In order to ensure
that the satellites can get images of surface targets under basically the same lighting conditions, and to carry out
cyclical repeat photography, earth resources satellites mostly use sun-synchronous return orbits, with orbital altitudes
of 500 kilometers to 900 kilometers and inclinations of ninety-seven degrees to ninety-nine degrees. Earth resources
satellites generally use a three-axis stabilization form of control.

The technical characteristics of satellite earth resources surveying systems [are as follows]. First, they can adapt to
many working environments and have many forms of work. In order to get sufficient earth data, earth resources satellites
need to work in such environments as strong light, weak light, and even dark nights. In order to meet remote sensing
needs under differing lighting conditions, the satellites use many forms of work such as spectroscopic imaging and
synthetic aperture radar imaging. Second, they are able to carry out multispectral and multi-perspective surveys. Earth
resources satellites carry visible-light, infrared, ultraviolet, and multispectral remote sensors, and can obtain
multispectral information, and they can use multiple perspectives to get threedimensional images that cover the entire
globe, thus meeting differing needs. Third, they can [do] repeat monitoring a number of times, in order to obtain
dynamic information. The satellites use sun-synchronous return orbits, and can do repeat monitoring a number of times
for a given region on the earth in a single day, getting dynamic materials and information for this region. Fourth, they
have powerful information transmission capabilities. The satellites operate in a sun-synchronous orbit, and receiving
all of the satellites’ information in real-time requires stations that are distributed globally, but this is neither
possible nor is it necessary. Therefore, the satellites are able to transmit data in a timely manner, using data
transmission devices with wide bandwidth and high speeds; in places where there are no surface collection stations, they
can use data storage devices on the satellite to store data, and wait until the satellite flies in space over the
collection station and then use high-speed transmission devices to quickly transmit the data. Earth resources satellites
make broad use of advanced remote sensing technology. Even though their resolution is slightly lower than that of
military reconnaissance satellites, they display great advantages in their uses.

# Section 2: Space Satellite Navigation and Positioning Systems...96

Space satellite navigation and positioning systems refer to satellite-borne systems that use navigation and positioning
satellites (abbreviated as navigation satellites) to provide navigation and positioning services for users on land, at
sea, in the air, and in space; they are navigation satellite networks (or constellations) composed of a number of
navigation satellites operating in differing orbital planes.

# I. Overview...96

Space satellite navigation and positioning systems are a space-based radio navigation positioning and time transfer
system for all weathers and all times, and that is highly precise. They can provide three-dimensional location, speed,
and time information for land vehicles and personnel as well as for aircraft, ships, submarines, and satellites in such
spheres as the air, the sea, and space. They can act as supplements to inertial guidance systems for mid-flight stage
guidance for intercontinental missiles, thus improving the accuracy of the missiles. They can also be used in geodetic
surveys, midair refueling, air transport, air traffic control, and command. The satellite navigation and positioning
system [sic] (GNSS) is similar to other long-range radio navigation systems; its greatest advantage is that the scope of
its effects is great (it can reach the entire globe) and the accuracy of its positioning is high (it can go from several
hundred meters to several dozen meters and even to several meters, and it can get even greater positioning accuracy by
differentiations).

Satellite navigation and positioning play an indispensably important role in the modern military and economic spheres,
they are an important component part of the foundation of a nation’s economy, and they are an important symbol that
shows the nation’s overall strength; the world’s powers are racing to compete in this sphere. The satellite navigation
and positioning systems that are currently already operating in orbit and have been put to use primarily consist of the
United States’ GPS satellite positioning system, Russia’s GLONASS satellite navigation system, and China’s Beidou
satellite navigation system (COMPASS), as well as the Galileo satellite navigation system that the European Union has
developed and is about to put into use. In addition, Japan is working to build a QuasiZenith Satellite System (QZSS)
made up of three satellites; the first satellite in this regional navigation system was launched in 2009. India has not
only formally participated in Russia’s GLONASS system and the European Union’s Galileo program, but it also announced,
in 2006, that it would research and develop a satellite navigation system for the India region, and that it would place
a constellation made up of seven satellites [into space] prior to 2011.

# II. Categories of satellite navigation and positioning systems...97

Satellite navigation and positioning systems have differing categories and methods in accordance with the different
forms in which they work and with their technological characteristics. In accordance with the principles of their work,
they can be divided into two types. The first is Doppler velocimetric navigation satellites; they measure the navigation
signal’s Doppler frequency shifts for users, and from this they seek the rate of change in distances, in order to derive
navigation and positioning. The other type is time and ranging navigation satellites; they measure the time of the
navigation signals propagation for users, in order to find distance, and thus derive navigation and positioning. Doppler
measurement of speed and position was the satellite navigation method that was used earliest. What the United States’
GPS and Russia’s GLONASS adopted was the time and ranging positioning method. According to whether the user needed to
propagate a signal to the satellite, this could be divided into active-type navigation and passive-type navigation
satellites. GPS and GLONASS both are passivetype navigation satellites; they have the advantages of being simple and
inexpensive, and having good confidentiality. China’s Beidou satellite navigation system is an active-type satellite
navigation system. In accordance with the altitude of the orbit, [satellites] can be divided into low earth orbit
satellites, medium earth orbit satellites, and geostationary satellites. Of these, active-type navigation satellites
currently do not include any medium earth orbit satellites, and passive-type navigation satellites currently do not
include any geostationary satellites. In accordance with the scope of their applications, they can also be divided into
global navigational systems and regional navigational systems.

# III. Typical satellite navigation and positioning systems...98

1. GPS satellite navigation system

The GPS satellite navigation system (Figure 4-2) was the first global satellite navigation and positioning system in the
world; it took the United States twenty years and cost more than $\$ 30$ billion to establish it. It was also called the
Navstar system. It was a US joint military-civilian satellite navigation and positioning system. Its military
applications were quite broad; it was the only highly precise global and all-weather navigation and positioning and time
transfer system that operated in a long-term and stable manner in all weathers and at all times. The GPS system was
completed in 1993, and was dominated and controlled by the US military. The system began to be carried out by the US
Department of Defense in 1973, and for a fairly long period of time it monopolized the global military and civilian
satellite navigation market. Starting in the [Bill] Clinton era, the system began to be used in civilian areas, and it
was opened to the entire world free of charge. The GPS system is an all-weather, real-time global navigation and
positioning system, and it can continuously provide three-dimensional positioning, three-dimensional speed, and
precision time information twenty-four hours a day, without interruption. Its positioning accuracy can reach ten meters,
its velocimetric precision is less than 0.1 meter/second, and its timing accuracy can reach 100 nanoseconds.

[Image: Missing image]
Figure 4-2: GPS Satellite Navigation System

The GPS system consists of three parts: a space segment, a control segment, and a user segment. The space segment is the
main part of the system, and it consists of twenty-four working satellites and three backup satellites distributed
within six orbital planes. The altitude of the satellite orbits is about 20,000 kilometers, the orbital inclination is
fiftyfive degrees, and all users in each area of the globe can simultaneously receive signals from at least four
navigation satellites at any time. The control segment consists of a tracking station network spread over the globe, as
well as a master control station (MCS) located in Colorado Springs in the United States. The tracking stations are used
to determine and predict satellite positions, and to monitor their automated clocks and system integrity. This
information is sent to the MCS, and the MCS regularly generates updated messages for each GPS satellite. Based on these
updated messages, the satellites will automatically synchronize their atomic clocks and adjust their internal orbital
model. The user segment consists of military and civilian devices. These satellites and ground support systems form a
network, and users’ GPS receivers broadcast the users’ position (longitude and latitude), speed, altitude, and time
information to [the users] every one to three seconds, based on positioning information that antennas simultaneously
receive from four to eight satellites and applying the principle of differential positioning.

In order to promote the development of GPS applications, the United States issued orders three times in the form of
presidential directives, standardizing the use and management of the system. Prior to 2004, the United States’
highest-level GPS management

organization was the interagency GPS Executive Board, which was jointly composed of the Department of Defense,
representing the military, and the Department of Transportation, representing the civilian side. Now, it is the newly
organized Space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) committee. In the military sphere, the US military makes
heavy use of GPS in the areas of command and control, weapons guidance, and personnel positioning; in the civilian
sphere, it is primarily concentrated in automobile navigation (monitoring), individuals’ navigation, and civilian
aviation navigation, and in areas of application related to precision monitoring of positioning parameters. Because GPS
signals do not broadcast information with integrity, safety and reliability are affected when they are used.

The United States’ GPS positioning system provides two services, that is, a standard service (SPS) and a precise
positioning service (PPS). The SPS is provided for civilian use, while the PPS is used by military users who have been
approved by the United States and by selected government department users, and it is strictly controlled. For a long
period of time, the United States’ GPS system only provided encrypted precision positioning information (with a
positioning accuracy of within three meters) to its own country’s military, in order to monopolize the global satellite
navigation market; for civilian users, including for other nations, it provided low-precision signals that had jamming
(with a positioning accuracy of about 100 meters).

GPS played a fairly major role in the several most recent wars, and it improved the navigation and positioning precision
of personnel, vehicles, ships, and aircraft to a fairly great degree. But some problems were also found; for example, it
was easily jammed electronically, GPS signals were weak in some regions, and positioning accuracy still needed to be
improved. In order to ensure its ability to control things in the military sphere and its monopoly position in the
civilian market, the United States has been energetically promoting a GPS modernization program since 1996, and it
intends to carry out a GPS III program after 2013, again greatly improving the accuracy, reliability, and security [of
GPS] as well as its anti-jamming ability, and getting maximum political, military, economic, and social benefits. At the
beginning of 2011, the US Department of Defense decided that in the construction of its GPS III system, it would abandon
its existing twenty-four satellites in medium earth orbit (MEO) and adopt a completely new [program of] thirty-three
“high earth orbit (HEO) plus geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites.” All of the satellites for the GPS III program will
be operating in orbit between 2015 and 2020.

2. The GLONASS satellite navigation system

In the 1970s, in reaction to the US announcement that it would establish and develop the GPS system, the Soviet Union’s
Ministry of Defense conceived of and constructed the GLONASS dual military-civilian navigation and positioning satellite
system (Figure 4-3). This was the Soviet Union’s second-generation satellite navigation system. The GLONASS project
began in 1976, and it was continued and carried out by Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed. In 1996, this system
momentarily achieved a model where twenty-four satellites were in orbit, providing global coverage. But later, because
of Russian economic difficulties, and because the working lifespan of the satellites was relatively brief, the number of
satellites in orbit was clearly insufficient, and this system collapsed and did not form a network. Starting in 2002,
Russia began strengthening the building of the GLONASS system. As [Russia’s] investment continued to grow, the process
of supplementing the GLONASS system’s network gradually accelerated.

[Image: Missing image]
Figure 4-3: GLONASS Navigation Satellite

The GLONASS system can provide all-weather, continuous, real-time, and highprecision three-dimensional positioning and
velocimetrics for ships at sea, aircraft in the air, users on the ground, and spacecraft in near-earth space; it can
also be used for geodetic surveys and high-precision satellite timing. Compared to the United States’ GPS system,
GLONASS uses differing orbits and signal frequencies, it pays more attention to covering areas at high latitudes, and it
has a stronger anti-jamming ability. The positioning accuracy of the GLONASS system is between thirty and 100 meters,
its velocimetric precision is 0.15 meter/second, and its timing accuracy is one microsecond. This system consists of a
space segment, a ground applications segment, and a user

segment. The design of the space segment of the GLONASS system is a constellation consisting of twenty-four satellites;
the twenty-four satellites are evenly distributed in three orbital planes at angles of 120 degrees, and each orbit has
eight satellites. The orbiting altitude for GLONASS satellites is 18,840 kilometers to 19,440 kilometers (the nominal
value is 19,100 kilometers, MEO), the orbital inclination is 64.8 plus or minus 0.3 degrees, and the operating cycle is
11 hours 15 minutes 44 seconds plus or minus 5 seconds.

GLONASS is managed by the Russian Air Force, and the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense’s Coordination Scientific
Information Center is responsible for its operations. Because of the short lifespan of GLONASS satellites, and because
of the impact of the Soviet Union’s collapse and Russia’s economic slide, this system was unable to provide
comprehensive and regular service for a long period of time; it could only be used together with GPS, and its
applications and popularity were far less than those of GPS. In recent years, as Russia’s economic situation has
improved and the satellite navigation and positioning market has flourished and developed, Russia has begun rebuilding
the GLONASS system; it has drafted and implemented a program for promoting the modernized building of GLONASS and has
actively recommended this system for the global civilian market. On 8 December 2011, Russia deployed the GLONASS-744
satellite, which it had most recently launched into space, as a regularly working satellite; this marked the first time
in fifteen years that Russia’s GLONASS global navigation satellite system had entered into comprehensive operations. The
twenty-four working satellites are all placed in predetermined orbits, their working state is excellent, and they can
provide global coverage service. In the next few years, Russia will incrementally adopt a new type of GLONASS-K
satellite to replace the existing GLONASS-M satellites; the first GLONASS-K satellite was launched into orbit in
February 2011. Russia also plans to launch a GLONASS-KM satellite in 2015, whose performance will be even more advanced.
At that time, the GLONASS system’s navigation and positioning error range will be reduced from the current five to six
meters to around one meter.

The GLONASS system’s return to global coverage has not only broken the United States’ monopoly position in the sphere of
global satellite navigation and can provide continuous, real-time, and precision navigation and positioning services for
global users, but what is even more important, it has laid a foundation for the Russian military to carry out joint
operations and precision attacks, and has enhanced its strategic deterrence capabilities; this has important
significance for Russia’s national security and economic development.

# 3. The Galileo Satellite Navigation System

In order to break out of the situation where the United States’ Global Positioning System dominated the world, and to
create a new stage for the European Union’s geodetic surveys and space industries, the European Union’s fifteen member
states on 27 March 2002 began to launch the Galileo satellite navigation and positioning system program (Figure 4-4).
Currently, it has established an entity called the Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU), which is responsible for managing
the research and development of the Galileo project. At the end of December 2005, the first Galileo satellite, GLOVEA,8
was launched into space; this marked the formal entry of the Galileo satellite positioning system into its construction
stage.

[Image: Missing image]
Figure 4-4: Galileo Navigation Satellite

The Galileo system is certainly not a duplication of the GPS or GLONASS systems; it is controlled by a civilian
organization, and at the same time also has participation from other, non-European Union countries, like China and
India, as well as involvement by private organizations. The Galileo system has a better constellation design, its
service coverage and positioning accuracy are higher, and it can provide information like system completeness parameters
and system error warnings. This system not only provides meter-level real-time navigation and precision accuracy, but it
also [is] effective in

issuing real-time signals and provides commercial navigation services, thus further improving the accuracy and
reliability of navigation and positioning, and it provides guarantees for applications for trains and automobiles that
have fairly high requirements for positioning services as well as for aircraft landings. The Galileo system can be
compatible with the GPS and GLONASS systems, and it provides diverse services for users. Galileo can primarily provide
services with five differing levels of accuracy, completeness, and reliability.

Just like the other satellite navigation and positioning systems, the Galileo system is also composed of three parts: a
space segment, a control segment, and a user segment. Of these, the space segment includes thirty MEO satellites evenly
distributed in three medium earth orbital planes (with three backup satellites); each plane includes one backup
satellite in order to protect against the working satellites having an accident. It takes about fourteen hours for the
satellites to revolve around the earth one time, and the satellites have a designed lifespan of twenty years. Galileo’s
control segment includes one sensor station network, two control centers, and multiple uplink stations. The sensor
network, which is distributed around the globe, continually monitors the constellation, and sends its precisely measured
navigation signals to the two control centers situated in Europe. The orbital and clock data produced by the control
centers is sent to the uplink stations, and transmitted to the satellites once every two hours. At the same time, the
control centers forecast the integrity of the constellation and provide these data to users in the life $\{ she ngm ing
\}$ security industry. When fault signals appear, the system can warn users after a delay of six to ten seconds.

Although the Galileo satellite navigation system was designed and planned in accordance with first-rate standards, as
regards its construction requirements and technical performance, the Galileo system has still not been completely built
because of funding, technical, and other reasons; the program has been continually delayed, and building of the entire
completed system still remains to be seen.

4. The Beidou satellite navigation system

The first-generation Beidou satellite navigation system (Figure 4-5) is a two-satellite navigation and positioning
system that China itself designed; this system ended China’s history of entirely relying on ground navigation and
foreign satellite navigation systems, and preliminarily established its own regional satellite navigation system;
together with the United States’ GPS system, Russia’s GLONASS system, and Europe’s Galileo system, it forms the globe’s
four great satellite navigation systems. In October and December 2000 and in May 2003, Beidou navigation test satellites
were successfully

launched, forming the first-generation Beidou satellite navigation system, and the system formally began operating in
2005.

[Image: Missing image]
Figure 4-5: Beidou Satellite Navigation System

The first-generation Beidou navigation system combines the three great functions of satellite positioning, short message
service messages, and high-precision timing into one; it is an all-weather, highly precise, and quick real-time regional
two-dimensional navigation and positioning system that can provide rapid positioning, short digital message
communications, and timing services for medium and low dynamic and static users in part of the Asia-Pacific sea regions
and part of the peripheral regions, and that can provide two forms of services: open services and authorized services.
Open services provide positioning, velocimetric, and timing services free of charge in the service area, the accuracy of
positioning is ten to twenty meters, the timing accuracy is fifty nanoseconds, and the velocimetric accuracy is 0.2
meters/second. The characteristics of the first-generation Beidou system primarily include [the following]. First, it
has a number of functions: positioning, timing, and short message communications. Second, it can be used to issue
wide-area differential information. Third, it has dual military-civilian use, with the military predominating. Fourth,
it uses the RDSS work system; at the same time that it [provides] positioning, it can report locations. Fifth, there is
no need to accumulate navigation messages, so first-time positioning is fast. Sixth, it broadcasts users’ locations
through communications links, and can [provide] positioning as well as be monitored.

The first-generation Beidou system uses a two-satellite positioning system; the basic principle of its positioning is
the measurement principle where three spheres intersect: the surface center broadcasts a querying signal (the outbound
signal) toward the user, by means of two satellites, then based on the answering signal (the inbound signal) of the
user’s response, it measures and calculates the distance from the user to the two satellites. Afterwards, based on a
digital map stored at the center or on the elevation measured by an altimeter carried by the user himself, it calculates
the distance from the user to the center of the earth, and based on these three distances, it can determine the location
of the user, and inform the user of the results of the location by means of the outbound signal. The timing and short
message communications functions also are simultaneously achieved through the transmission process of these outbound and
inbound signals.

The first-generation Beidou system consists of a satellite system and a ground applications system. The space segment
consists of three geosynchronous satellites at an altitude of approximately 36,000 kilometers, of which two are working
satellites and one is an orbiting backup satellite. The first-generation Beidou’s ground applications system includes a
central control system, a calibration system, and various types of users’ machines. Because the first-generation Beidou
system uses a passive positioning system, the system has certain restrictions in such areas as user capacity, the
precision of positioning, concealment, and positioning frequency, and the system has no velocimetric function and so
cannot meet the high-precision guidance needs of long-range precision attack weapons. However, compared to other
satellite navigation systems, this system’s investment is much smaller, and it also has positioning reporting and
communications functions that the other systems lack. Therefore, it can be said that the first-generation Beidou system
is a satellite navigation system that is fairly cost-effective and that has its own characteristics.

Ever since the first-generation Beidou was put into operation in 2005, it has made comprehensive breakthroughs in the
national economy’s key industries in such spheres as the transportation of hazardous chemicals, the ocean fishing
industry, and timing for the national grid, which has pulled and promoted developments in relevant production such as
electronics, communications, machinery manufacturing, and geographical information. It has produced notable economic and
social benefits and become a new point of growth for the national economic and social development. In the next few
years, Beidou will also launch a series of satellites, one after the other, and network and test the system,
incrementally expanding it into a global satellite navigation system, that is, the secondgeneration Beidou satellite
navigation system. The second-generation Beidou satellite navigation system will be built in accordance with the overall
thinking of “first regional and then global,” and will be implemented step by step.

5. Other satellite navigation and positioning systems

In addition to these four major satellite navigation and positioning systems, many countries also are actively
developing their own satellite navigation and positioning systems, such as Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System,
India’s regional satellite navigation system, Canada’s Active Control System (CACS) and Germany’s Satellite Positioning
and Navigation Service System (SAPOS).

(1) Japan’s Quasi-Zenith system

In recent years, the Japanese Government has cooperated with industrial circles (the Japan Federation of Economic
Organization), and is now establishing a Japanese satellite navigation and positioning system based on GPS – the
Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), to serve as a new generation of Japanese satellite navigation and positioning
system. The Quasi-Zenith system can be used together with the twenty-four satellites of the United States’ GPS,
enhancing the precision of positioning and strengthening the ability to resist jamming. Because the orbits of the
Quasi-Zenith satellites differ from each other, then even though they use the same frequencies, they will not interfere
with each other, and in this way it is possible to greatly enhance the utilization of the QuasiZenith system’s
frequencies. In addition, the Quasi-Zenith also can supplement blind spots in Japan’s satellite reconnaissance.
Currently, Japan’s reconnaissance satellites still have no way to reconnoiter the globe’s north and south polar regions,
but the QuasiZenith satellite system can supplement these deficiencies.

The Quasi-Zenith satellite system consists of three navigation satellites; the three satellites are in a circular orbit
about 36,000 kilometers from the earth and move at a speed of one circuit each day. Where they differ from
geosynchronous satellites is that each satellite has a different orbit, and these three orbits are on a plane that forms
an angle of forty-five degrees from the earth’s equator. Therefore, looking at them from Japan’s homeland, there always
is one satellite remaining in a place close to the apex of the sky, so the Japanese call this a “quasi-zenith” satellite
system. In this way, all of Japan can enjoy a greater scope of coverage and more precise positioning services. Its
characteristics [are as follows]. First, the Quasi-Zenith system only has navigational functions; it does not have
mobile communications and broadcasting functions. Second, the satellites’ angle of elevation is more than sixty degrees,
which helps in resolving the blind spots in “urban canyon” coverage, so the rate of coverage can reach 100 percent.
Third, it will help in carrying out more accurate global positioning. Fourth, it can improve the utilization of high
frequency bands. Fifth, it can monitor the north and south polar regions, which synchronous orbiting satellites cannot
monitor, thus providing additional valuable materials for scientific research.

(2) India’s regional navigation satellite system

India’s regional navigation satellite system is a regional dual military-civilian satellite navigation system research
and development project that India has focused on promoting in recent years and that has autonomous intellectual
property rights and independent operating capabilities. This project can provide India with the ability for independent
regional navigation and positioning, and the system’s design also fully takes into consideration its future
compatibility and interoperability with GPS, Galileo, and other systems. After the Indian regional navigation satellite
system is built, it will be able to help India’s military monitor the border regions of the Indian subcontinent, regions
with complex terrain, and the Indian Ocean region. The Indian Government in May 2006 formally approved the launching of
the research and development program, and proposed the establishment of a regional navigation and positioning system
with a network of seven satellites. This program also required the ability to provide navigation and positioning
services for all of India’s territory and for regions within a scope of 2,000 kilometers along its periphery, with a
positioning accuracy within twenty meters. In September 2007, then-chairman of the Indian space research organization,
Madhavan Nair, publicly announced at an international space conference that India planned to launch seven navigation
satellites over the next six years, one after another, and to create an Indian version of GPS in outer space. Based on
its design, the Indian regional navigation satellite system’s satellites will be visible at all times, and the system
will be able to provide standard positioning services, accurate positioning services, and services to users having
special permission from the Indian Government. In addition to providing navigation and positioning services, the system
will also provide such services as ground monitoring, long-range communications, information transmission, evaluations
of disaster situations, and public safety.

In addition to the Indian regional navigation satellite system having a space-based satellite constellation, the system
will also include a master control center and some ground installations that will be responsible for satellite tracking
and control, in order to ensure the system’s integrity. It will include a space satellite control center, monitoring
stations, tracking and injection stations $\{ cek ong zhu ruz han \} ,$ time centers, ranging stations, CDMA ranging
stations, laser ranging stations, navigation control centers, and data links. Of these, the tracking stations’ primary
function will be to receive data from the geostationary satellites and inclined geosynchronous satellites, and at the
same time to correct the ranging values of these satellites, and to directly transmit the original data and ranging
corrected values to the navigation control center. The primary function of the navigation control center will be to
calculate satellite ephemeris, parameters for correcting satellite clock errors, the ionospheric delay error numbers,
and corresponding integrity information, and to transmit the results of the calculations to the upload injection
stations; afterwards, this will pass through the global satellite control center, which will be responsible for
managing, controlling, and safeguarding the regular work of the orbiting satellites. The CDMA ranging stations and laser
ranging stations will be responsible for collecting the satellite ranging information, and after they correct this, for
sending it to the satellite control center. The user segment primarily will include specially designed single-frequency
user receivers and dual-frequency user receivers. All the receivers will, in addition to receiving signals from the
Indian regional navigation satellite system, also be able to receive signals from the space GPS and GLONASS; at the same
time, the single-frequency receiver users will be able to receive corresponding ionospheric error correction
information.

This first satellite navigation system that India will independently build still has a great deal of crucial technology
that has yet to be perfected, including atomic time standards, building the ground stations and master control center,
users’ receivers, and time conversion technology; these are all pending completion of technological research.
Particularly as regards the research and development of crucial miniature precision positioning payloads, India still
needs to rely upon international cooperation with the United States, Russia, and the European Union. For example, India
currently still has no way to produce crucial technological parts and satellite-borne atomic clocks for satellite
positioning. For this reason, India has signed a contract worth four million euros with the SpectraTime Company, which
belongs to France’s Orolia Group, requiring that [SpectraTime] provide the satellite system with rubidium atomic clocks.

# Section 3: Space Information Transmission Systems...107

Space information transmission systems refer to such things as satellite communications and tracking and data relay
satellite systems. Space information transmission systems will be completely fused digitized battlefield command and
control network systems at the strategic, campaign, and tactical levels. Their main function and mission will be to
complete the transmission and distribution of strategic, tactical, and battlefield information (to include sounds,
image, data, and numbers), and to deliver to the ultimate user information products from the ground comprehensive
processing and management center, in order to meet the needs that informationized operations have for command and
control coordinated operations, firepower attack, and information and communication support.

# I. Satellite communications systems...107

# 1. Overview

Satellite communications systems refer to radio communications systems that have satellites as their relay stations and
that can transmit telephone calls, television, cables, faxes, and data; their main equipment includes communications
antennas, signal processors, and signal repeaters. Satellite communications systems achieve communications links between
earth stations, between earth stations and spacecraft, and between spacecraft, through forwarding or emitting radio
signals. Satellite communications systems are the main means of long-distance strategic communication, and they have a
pivotal role in military communications; more than ninety percent of the long-distance military communications tasks of
the United States, Russia, and other countries are shouldered by satellite communications systems. Currently, ninety
percent of intercontinental communications services throughout the world and 100 percent of intercontinental television
broadcasts, as well as a great deal of the regional communications, are undertaken by satellites, and there are more
than 300 communications satellites working in orbit. In the 1991 Gulf War, the multinational force headed by the United
States established a huge satellite communications system; the US and British militaries mobilized a total of six
communications satellites to form a comprehensive communications system, which provided communications support for the
multinational force’s operations, from the strategic level to the tactical level. In addition, they also used field
satellite communications systems in order to provide communications support for command activities [carried out] by
basic-level units (or combat units).

Satellite communications systems have the following advantages. First, the scope of their coverage is great, and
communications distances are far. One geostationary communications satellite can cover forty percent of the earth’s
surface, and three communications satellites equally spaced in geostationary orbit can carry out global communications,
apart from some of the south and north polar regions. Second, the capacity of communications is great. Currently, the
capacity of one satellite can reach tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of circuits, and can forward
high-resolution photographs and other information. Third, the quality of transmission is great. Communications
satellites are not affected by natural conditions like terrain and surface features, and they are not easily affected by
natural or manmade jamming and changes in communications distances, so communications are stable and reliable. Fourth,
they have good mobility. Communications satellites can act as long-distance communications trunk lines between
large-scale ground stations, and can also provide communications for small-scale mobile terminals in aircraft, on ships,
and in vehicles; they can quickly establish communications links with various directions, based on need. The

confidentiality of military communications satellites is even better, and their ability to resist jamming is even
stronger.

The main developmental trends in satellite communications systems are that confidentiality in satellite communications,
resisting jamming, and the mobility of ground terminal stations are being comprehensively improved, as is survival
capabilities under the conditions of nuclear warfare. The focus is on enlarging communications capacity and permitting
large numbers of tactical users to communicate, and on enhancing the ability to resist attacks and resist destruction.
For example, satellite systems in high earth orbit, medium earth orbit, and low earth orbit are developing in parallel,
and they are launching the use of multibeam antenna and ultra-precision antenna technology, optical communications
technology, high-speed satellite-borne signal processing and switching technology, technology for military applications
of direct-broadcasting satellites, and high temperature superconducting transponder technology.

2. Classifications of satellite communications systems

There are many methods for classifying satellite communications systems. For example, in differentiating them in
accordance with their operating orbits, satellite communications systems can be divided into geostationary orbit, high
elliptical orbit, and medium and low earth orbit satellite communications systems; in differentiating them in accordance
with the scope of their services, they can be divided into international, domestic, and regional satellite
communications systems; and in differentiating them in accordance with their services, they can be divided into fixed
service and mobile service satellite communications systems. Looking at their military applications, satellite
communications systems usually are divided into two main types of satellite communications systems: strategic
communications and tactical communications. Strategic satellite communications systems are primarily used in global
strategic communications; they usually operate in geosynchronous orbits and use superhigh frequencies (SHF, three
gigahertz to thirty gigahertz) and extremely high frequencies (EHF, thirty gigahertz to 300 gigahertz) frequency bands,
and provide services for the transmission of strategic commands, control, communications, and intelligence over long
distances up to a global scope. Tactical communications satellites, on the other hand, provide regional tactical
communications, including mobile communications for terminals in military aircraft, ships, vehicles, and even small
detachments or for ones that are carried on individual soldiers’ backs. Tactical satellite communication systems
generally operate in elliptical orbits with periods of twelve hours, and primarily provide communications service for
the movements of military aircraft and surface ships. Since the 1980s, as communications satellite technology has
developed, and especially as high-powered communications transponders have come into use, satellite communications
systems are developing in the direction of large platforms and being multi-functional; the differentiations between
strategic and tactical communications satellites are no longer distinct, and multiple-use and joint military-civilian
communications satellites have become a new direction of development.

3. Typical satellite communications systems

Currently, apart from the United States and Russia, NATO has the NATO series of military satellite communications
system, the United Kingdom has the Skynet series of military satellite communications system, and France has the
Syracuse military satellite communications system. The US military has researched and established a global satellite
communications system with multiple uses and has begun transformative construction of its satellite communications
system.

(1) The United States’ Defense Satellite Communications System

The Defense Satellite Communications System is a global strategic satellite communications system that the US Department
of Defense constructed in order to adapt to the needs of modernized operations; the system undertakes most of the
Department of Defense’s satellite communications affairs. This system began to be built in May 1962; [the construction]
was carried out in three stages, and development now has reached the third generation. The first-generation Defense
Satellite Communications System (DSCS1) satellites were small and functioned poorly, and their communications
capabilities were extremely limited. The second generation (DSCS-2) was a global communications network consisting of
four satellites in geostationary orbit and was the main communications system for the military prior to the 1980s.
Research and development of the third generation (DSCS-3) began in 1972; it not only was suitable for large-scale fixed
earth stations and ship-borne terminals, but it also was suitable for small-scale mobile terminals, and could
simultaneously satisfy strategic and tactical communications needs; it is currently the main satellite communications
system used by the US military. The Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) can provide global communications for
all of the US military’s services and service arms.

On the eve of the 1991 Gulf War, [the number of] DSCS-3 satellite terminals that the US military deployed in the Gulf
region increased from four to more than 120, and they were used to complete combat, combat support, combat logistics
support, and other communications missions. The multinational force’s air force headquarters used Defense Satellite
Communications System every day to send air raid mission orders to the various operational units, making air attacks
timely and effective. The antennas for ground mobile unit users’ terminals were installed on flatbed trucks and followed
units’

movements; when the units halted, [the terminals] established contact with command posts. In all, there were
thirty-three mobile terminals serving combat units, providing prompt command, control, communications, and intelligence
information. In the initial period of the war, the Defense Satellite Communications System undertook seventy-five
percent of theater of war communications; in particular, it played a major support role for units that were fairly far
from the theater of war and that had no ground communications systems support.

(2) Russia’s Molniya satellite communications system

The Soviet Union was the earliest country in the world to launch a satellite, and its satellite communication system
also developed fairly early. In 1965, not only did it launch the first Molniya communications experimental satellite,
but it also began establishing a satellite communications system. Currently, the Molniya-3 communications satellite
system used by Russia is its third generation, and it primarily provides strategic communications service for the
military.

The Molniya satellite communications system has the following characteristics. First, the satellites have a high
elliptical orbit with a twelve-hour period, their perigee is at about 500 kilometers in the southern hemisphere, and
their orbital inclination is sixty-five degrees. This is because most of Russia’s territory is located in the high
latitude regions of the northern hemisphere, and some of its territory is in the north polar region; if a geostationary
orbit were used, the communications effects would not be good, and moreover there would be no way to have communications
in the north polar region. But by using a high elliptical orbit and having the apogee adjusted to the space above the
northern hemisphere, it is possible to have the satellites’ longest flight time be in the space above [Russia’s] own
territory. The Molniya satellites usually work in a network of eight satellites, operating in four orbital planes
separated ninety degrees from each other in a dual mode. In this way, it is possible to ensure continual global
communications twenty-four hours [a day]. Second, the communications capacity is limited. A Molniya satellite only has
three transponders and can provide only 200 circuits for telephone calls or three circuits for television, so it has a
certain disparity with the large capacity requirements of strategic communications. Third, [the satellites] have great
need for ground systems; their ground applications systems consist of eighty-five ground stations. Because Molniya
satellites operate in a high elliptical orbit, the antennas of their ground systems need to continually track the
satellites, so the technology is more complex.

(3) The United States’ Milstar system

The United States’ Milstar system, whose full name is the Military Strategic and Tactical Relay system and which uses
extremely high frequency (EHG) wavebands, is the most advanced satellite communications system in today’s world. This
system combines strategic communications, tactical communications, and data relay functions into one. The Milstar
satellite communications system began undergoing research and development in the 1980s and by now has already had two
generations develop, respectively Milstar 1 and Milstar 2. Milstar 1’s reinforcement against nuclear [explosions] was
fairly strong, and it was primarily used for strategic communications. Milstar 2 has no reinforcement against nuclear
[explosions], and it is primarily used for tactical communications. The constellation consists of two Milstar 1 and
three Milstar 2 satellites, for a total of five [satellites]. The system’s main characteristics [are as follows]. First,
its communications capacity is great and its processing capabilities are strong. The satellites have fifteen secondary
antennas and use such autonomous processing systems as signals code processing, capturing and processing of timing and
signals, processing of links between satellites, and overall processing, and they have signal modulation and
demodulation [functions] and beam switching functions. They use three frequency bands: ultrahigh frequency, superhigh
frequency, and extremely high frequency, simultaneously supporting strategic and tactical communications. They use sixty
gigahertz broadband links to carry out communications among satellites, linking a number of satellites in orbit to form
a constellation. Second, they use adaptive nulling antenna technology to improve their ability to resist jamming. What
is called adaptive nulling antennas means that the antenna’s main beams are always aligned with the signals direction,
and the signals null point is always aligned with the source of jamming. Because jamming is random, adaptive nulling
antennas can automatically adjust to changes in the antenna direction pattern, and always track the direction of
jamming. In addition, because the beam length is quite short and the beams are quite narrow, it is possible [to have]
highly directional emissions, making it quite hard to eavesdrop on and jam [signals]. In addition, satellites’
regenerative processing technology limits the accumulation of noise and jamming, thus further enhancing the system’s
anti-jamming ability. At the same time, the extensive use of narrowband and broadband spread spectrum and frequency
modulated technology also makes it very difficult for the enemy to intercept their communication. Third, it works using
the form of networks whose orbits intersect, thus enhancing resistance to destruction and survival capabilities. Some
satellites’ orbits are higher than geostationary orbits, for fairly long periods of time, and anti-satellite means
cannot reach this altitude. Satellites in geostationary orbit also adopt preventive measures, taking along sufficient
fuel, so that as soon as they come under attack, they can immediately ignite their engines and engage in flexible
dodging and mobile shifts. Backup satellites that are placed in orbit do not work in peacetime and are put in a secret
status; they can move, based on

orders, and reinforce the system’s work capabilities from a suitable location. Therefore, the Milstar system also can
provide regular communications services in a complex battlefield environment and has quite strong survival capabilities.

# II. Tracking and data relay satellite systems...111

# 1. Overview

Tracking and data relay satellite systems are space relay stations that can track earth orbit flight vehicles, including
space shuttles, and can return data to earth stations. They are one of the important means for carrying out global
reconnaissance and surveillance and for providing real-time information delivery for strategic early warning, as well as
an indispensably important component part in establishing a global space-based comprehensive information network. They
are primarily used for real-time relay transmission of information for various types of low earth orbit spacecraft
users, and for expanding the scope of coverage for low earth orbit spacecraft tracking. Tracking and data relay
satellite systems not only are hubs by which medium and near earth orbit spacecraft transmit information in real-time,
but they also are important platforms for forming space-based tracking networks. They also have a very important role in
manned spaceflight and deep-space probes. Because the amount of data that imaging reconnaissance satellites transmit is
quite large, and because it is necessary to prevent data interception by other nations, it is therefore necessary to
rely upon data relay satellites to carry out high-capacity, high-speed data relay in real-time.

Currently, the United States, the European Union, and Japan are developing new generations of tracking and data relay
satellite systems; data transmission speeds are getting faster and faster, and communications frequency bands are
developing towards the Ka band and optical frequency bands.

2. Typical satellite relay systems (1) The United States’ “Tracking and Data Relay Satellites”

In 1975, the United States began research and development of “Tracking and Data Relay Satellites” (TDRS). From 1983 to
1995, it launched a total of seven first-generation TDRS satellites; the satellites had seven differing types of
antennas and could simultaneous use S, C, and Ku bands, while their data transmission speeds reached 300 megabits per
second. These satellites and a ground station set up in White Sands, New Mexico, formed the United States’
first-generation TDRS network, and its coverage in near earth orbit reached eighty-five percent. Starting in 1995, the
United States planned to research second-generation TDRS satellites, whose working frequency bands would be S, Ku, and
Ka, and that would develop toward the Ka band, so that the space-based tracking network would have coverage of 85
percent to 100 percent. This system can transmit in real-time various types of data information from earth-monitoring
satellites, such as Lacrosse reconnaissance satellites forwarding SAR imaging data, and transmitting information
services for a new generation of the Earth Observing System (EOS).

(2) Russia’s tracking and data relay satellite system

Russia’s tracking and data relay satellite system is divided into two main categories: civilian and military. The
civilian tracking and data relay satellite system is divided into three independent networks – eastern, central, and
western – and is called the Luch system. This system’s primarily direction of service was to provide communications and
control for low earth orbit satellites and to provide two-way data exchanges with earth stations for the Mir space
station, the Salyut space station, Soyuz spaceships, and the Almaz [satellite’s] synthetic aperture radar. The Potok
military tracking and data relay satellite system, which was launched in 1982, used the C band, and the satellite
antenna was a phased array antenna; it was primarily used for optical imaging reconnaissance, ocean monitoring, and
other military satellites.

# Section 4: Space Operations Weapons Systems...113

The huge role in warfare of satellites and other spacecraft has resulted in an everincreasing number of countries fully
realizing the necessity and importance of developing space weapons. At the same time that they are actively developing
satellites, space shuttles, space stations, and other military spacecraft, the issue of how to prevent an enemy from
using space or how to carry out a counterattack when the enemy launches an assault against your own spacecraft, of how
to bring the altitude advantage of space into play, of how to seize and hold command of space, and of how to attack
ground, aerial, and maritime targets from space, have all impelled the applications of space weapons.

Space operations weapons systems conceptually are divided into a narrow sense and a broad sense. Space operations
weapons systems in the narrow sense refer especially to weapons systems deployed on space-based platforms and directly
used to kill the opponent’s outer space, aerial, maritime, and land operations targets. Space operations weapons systems
in the broad sense refer to weapons systems deployed in outer space, on land, at sea, and in the air that are used to
attack and destroy enemy targets flying in outer space and to attack from outer space important targets on land, at sea,
and in the air. Looking at functions, space operations weapons systems can be divided into two

categories: hard kill and soft kill. Speaking specifically, they primarily include antisatellite weapons, anti-ballistic
missile weapons, and orbital bombardment weapons. Anti-satellite weapons refer to weapons systems used to jam or damage
satellites operating in outer space; these are currently a relatively mature type of space operations weapons system.
Currently, anti-satellite weapons largely can be divided into three types. The first is kinetic energy weapons,
including anti-satellite missiles with nuclear warheads or conventional warheads and kinetic energy interceptors that
rely upon direct collisions to kill the [enemy] satellite. The second is directed energy weapons, including laser
weapons, particle beam weapons, and high-powered microwave weapons. The third is electronic warfare weapons, which are
used to jam satellites’ communications and data transmissions.

# I. Hard kill weapons systems in space operations...113

Hard kill weapons systems in space operations refer to space-based weapons systems that use various kinds of weapons
systems to directly destroy spacecraft themselves. According to differences in the means of hard kill, they normally can
be divided into two kinds: nuclear energy and non-nuclear energy. Nuclear energy space weapons refer to weapons that use
the thermal radiation, nuclear radiation, and electromagnetic pulse effects produced by explosions of nuclear devices to
damage the structures of targets or to render them ineffective. They primarily include nuclear electromagnetic pulse
bombs, enhanced x-ray bombs {zengqiang x shexian dan}, and gamma ray bombs. The lethal scope of nuclear energy space
weapons is large, and so they do not have very high requirements for precision in guidance; any long-range ballistic
missile that can carry nuclear warheads can act as an anti-satellite weapon. However, space nuclear explosions will
indiscriminately damage all satellites within their killing scope, including the enemy’s, your own, and allied nations’
satellites. In the 1970s, when levels of guidance technology were relatively poor, this scheme was the only choice, but
now the various nations all have abandoned it. Non-nuclear energy space weapons refer to weapons and equipment that use
the offensive killing effects produced by non-nuclear devices to carry out space offensives. Non-nuclear energy space
weapons can be divided into two types – kinetic energy and directed energy – and they are the space operations weapons
and equipment that the various nations are currently researching and using on a broad scale.

# 1. Kinetic energy weapons

Kinetic energy weapons refer to weapons that rely upon launching interceptor warheads that move at high speeds and that
are trajectory, homing, and guided [types], and that use their entire body or fragments from an explosion to directly
collide with and kill targets. The term kinetic energy weapons first appeared in United States’ Strategic Defense

Initiative of the early 1980s (that is, the Star Wars program). Kinetic energy weapons primarily are composed of two
large sections, an interception warhead and a high-speed launching apparatus. The interceptor warhead usually uses a
homing guidance type, but can also [use] a trajectory type, and it is primarily composed of an infrared or radar probe,
computer, guidance and communications systems, and a killing mechanism, as well as propulsion and control systems; the
high-speed launch apparatus primarily uses booster rockets but can also use an electromagnetic launch apparatus. In
accordance with differences in the form of deployment, kinetic energy weapons are divided into four types: space-based
kinetic energy weapons, ground-based kinetic energy weapons, airborne kinetic energy weapons, and sea-launched kinetic
energy weapons; in accordance with their mechanisms of action, they can be divided into kinetic energy interceptors,
electromagnetic cannon, and the like. Currently, kinetic energy weapons that have a certain ability for actual combat
consist of the United States’ airborne anti-satellite missiles, land-based kinetic energy anti-satellite weapons
systems, and space-based antisatellite systems, and Russia’s kinetic energy anti-satellite systems.

Compared to traditional weapons and directed energy weapons, kinetic energy weapons have their own advantages. First,
land-based kinetic energy weapons are not affected by the weather, and so can operate in all weathers. Second, their
destructive capabilities are strong, and it is easy to determine the effects of operations. And third, their forms of
deployment are flexible and their survival capabilities are strong, and it is hard for opponents to take precautions
against them when they attack. These are major reasons why kinetic energy weapons can continually and rapidly develop.
Compared to directed energy weapons, the drawbacks to kinetic energy weapons are that they are slow, they operate only
over short distances, they cannot be repeatedly used, and they currently still have difficulties in dealing with fast
targets that are far away and with multiple targets. The most crucial technology in kinetic energy weapons is precision
homing guidance; the more precise they are, the less quality and speed their interception warheads will need, and the
better the results of their operations will be. In order to improve the success rate of interception, some kinetic
energy interceptors have some apparatus added to their warhead parts, such as large high-speed projectiles or
umbrella-shaped steel rods.

In the 1980s, the United States and the Soviet Union energetically developed kinetic energy weapons technology. The
United States made some major progress in the area of such crucial technologies as probes and guidance, and it often
demonstrated the antimissile and anti-satellite abilities of its rocket-propelled kinetic energy weapons. In 1990, the
US Department of Defense’s Strategic Defense Initiative Organization also carried out the first suborbital flight tests
of the Bright Pebbles [project], as well as the first atmospheric flight tests of the High Endoatmospheric Defense
Interceptor (HEDI).

(1) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors

Space-based kinetic energy weapons are a space killer with totally new concepts and that are completely different from
conventional warheads or nuclear warheads. They are primarily composed of several parts, such as a supersonic launch
mechanism (that is, a propulsion system), a probe system, a guidance system, and a projectile. Space-based kinetic
energy weapons that have been developed or are currently under development primarily include space-based kinetic energy
interceptors, outer space railguns, and Brilliant Pebbles. Space-based kinetic energy interceptors are mainly used to
intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles (these can also be used against satellites). They are space-based weapons
that accelerate “projectiles” to a very high speed, using supersonic launching apparatus installed on spacecraft and
that use guidance systems to destroy targets that the probe system has found, such as aircraft, spacecraft, or enemy
spacebased weapons.

(2) Railguns

Electromagnetic orbiting cannon are also called coilguns; they consist of a series of fixed accelerator coils along with
projectile-mounted moving coils wrapped around a miniature sabot. When these coils power up in accordance with
procedures, they produce a moving magnetic field, which thus impels the miniature sabot that is in the magnetic field to
accelerate and then fire. Railguns use multiple magnetic fields to again combine and produce new magnetic field
structure with even greater capacity, accelerating and firing the miniature sabots in multiple stages. The main
technical difficulty of railguns is in enhancing the quality and speed of the sabot.

# 2. Directed energy weapons

Directed energy weapons refer to weapons systems that directly illuminate and damage targets by means of firing
high-energy laser beams, particle beams, and microwave beams. In accordance with the form that the energy effects take,
directed energy weapons can be divided into conventional directed energy weapons and nuclear directed energy weapons.
Conventional directed energy weapons include high-energy laser weapons and high-energy particle beams (neutral hydrogen
atomic beams and electron beams) weapons. Nuclear directed energy weapons include nuclear-pumped X-ray lasers, directed
electromagnetic pulse shells, and directed plasma weapons. In accordance with the way they are deployed, directed energy
weapons can be divided into three types: space-based, land-based, and sea-based. In accordance with their operating
mechanisms, they can also be divided into high-energy laser weapons, particle beam weapons, microwave weapons, and the
like. Directed energy weapons can carry out soft kills

against satellites and missiles (such as using lasers to temporarily blind satellite and missile optical probes), but
they can also carry out hard kills (such as destroying certain critical parts of satellites and missiles), so their
operational uses are very flexible. Not only are they suitable against satellites orbiting in low earth orbit, but they
are also suitable against satellites orbiting in high earth orbit and against ballistic missiles, and they can
repeatedly fire. However, their drawback is that it is easy for targets to adopt measures to strengthen their
countermeasures, and it is not easy to judge the effects of the kills. Ground-based directed energy weapons are easily
limited by meteorological and other conditions when they are being used in operations.

Directed energy weapons usually consist of such parts as the directed energy pulse source, the firing transmission
system, target acquisition tracking and identification, and the kill evaluation system. They can instantaneously attack
rapidly moving targets thousands of kilometers away (such as intercontinental ballistic missiles’ boosters, postboost
vehicles, decoys, and military satellites), so that these are destroyed or identified and can be quickly be targeted
again. The use of means of directed energy kills to destroy space targets is characterized by quick speed and broad
areas of attack, but technologically, it is fairly difficult to achieve. Currently, the United States, Russia, and other
military powers are actively researching and testing these, and it is estimated that in the near future, they will be
able to research and develop directed energy hard kill weapons that can meet the needs of actual warfare.

# (1) High-energy laser weapons

High-energy laser weapons (also called powerful laser weapons and laser cannons) refer to directed energy weapons that
use the excited materials of such external energy sources as light energy, thermal energy, chemical energy, or nuclear
energy to have these emit special high-energy light beams produced by stimulated radiation, so that they blind or
destroy enemy targets. They generally consist of a high-energy laser, a precision aiming and tracking system, and a
light beam controlled-firing system. Lasers are a directed energy weapon that has many functions and uses; by mounting
laser weapons on spacecraft such as satellites, spaceships, and space stations, it is possible to use them to destroy
various types of enemy military satellites, missiles, and other weapons. This kind of laser weapon can intercept
[targets] head on, and they can also pursue and attack from the side or the tail. Because the carrier spacecraft for
these weapons are very steady, without interference issues from airflows and shaking, the energy from lasers mounted on
spacecraft can be fully brought into play.

Currently, there are primarily three types of laser weapons that have a certain amount of capability in operations. The
first are US land-based anti-satellite laser weapons. US

land-based anti-satellite laser weapons are fairly mature and have already undergone numerous tests. They mainly consist
of the Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) and Sea-stone light beam director (SLED)9. A second is the United
States’ airborne laser weapons system (ABL). The United States’ airborne laser weapons system uses a Boeing 747-400F
aircraft as the platform, and consists of an oxygen-iodine chemical high energy laser, a passive infrared sensor, and an
aiming and tracking system. It can counter ballistic missiles, [enemy] satellites, and [enemy] aircraft. Its primary
advantages are its excellent mobility and the large scope of its operations; its drawbacks are that the system is
complex, it is very difficult to support, and every theater of war needs to have seven combat aircraft, in groups of
two, to carry out missions. The third are space-based laser weapons systems (SBL). Space-based laser weapons concentrate
highenergy laser weapons centers on a satellite platform, which can counter satellites and counter ballistic missiles.
Their advantage is that there is no impact from the atmosphere on laser transmission and they are steadier that airborne
laser weapons and easier to operate; their drawbacks are that the scope of operations is restricted, and their
difficulty is that they need to have the lasers be small in size but very powerful, and this is a contradiction
technologically.

# (2) High-powered microwave weapons

High-powered microwave weapons are also called radio frequency weapons; they refer to directed energy weapons that use
the energy of powerful microwave beams to destroy the electronic devices or personnel in targets like aircraft,
missiles, and spacecraft. They are a weapon that uses radio wave energy to attack targets. High-powered microwave
weapons are characterized by their radiation microwaves (radio waves with a wavelength of one meter to one millimeter),
and therefore they are also called radio wave weapons and radio frequency weapons. High-powered microwave weapons
generally consist of a super-high powered microwave emitter, a large-scale antenna, a power source, and other sets of
equipment; their structure is similar to the transmitting section of a radar, but the energy of their radiation must be
a hundred times or up to 10,000 times greater than that of a radar. The radiation frequency of the microwaves is often
in the one gigahertz to thirty gigahertz range, and the pulse power that is transmitted reaches the gigawatt level.
Based on the strength of the microwave energy, high-powered microwave weapons not only can carry out soft kills but also
can carry out hard kills.

High-powered microwave weapons have the following characteristics. First, they can attack in all weathers. Microwave
weapons are not affected by any weather conditions, and can attack enemy electronic devices at the speed of light.
Second, they can carry out attacks at differing levels. They can carry out surgical strikes at specific degrees of
operations, and based on the nature of the target and the operational mission, they engage in destruction and
interruption [of targets], or degrading of [the target’s] capabilities. Third, they have excellent directionality and a
definite scope of coverage. They can carry out attacks against targets on a broad scope, but they can also deal with a
given specific target, that is, the radiation scope of microwaves can be changed. Fourth, the scope of operations is
broad. High-tech weapons and equipment universally use electronic or optoelectronic parts, and therefore, high-powered
microwave weapons can attack virtually all [of these] weapons and equipment; attacks are particularly effective against
the large numbers of satellites and missiles that use electronic parts.

The mechanism of operations for high-powered microwave weapons is that they concentrate very powerful microwave energy
produced by the microwave generator into a narrow beam by means of very narrow pulses through an antenna; this is
directed and projected at targets in space and in the air or on land and at sea, damaging the sensors and receptor
portions of the enemy’s electronic system, burning out [the system’s] electronic components, and disrupting its digital
circuits, and even directly destroying equipment. Compared to particle beam weapons and powerful laser weapons,
microwave weapons have fairly broad beams, and thus a relatively large scope of illumination and killing. In addition,
they are not affected very much by the weather and smoke and other battlefield environments, so they are fairly suitable
for operations. However, concentrating the energy of microwave weapons requires using large-scale antennas, and it is
very difficult to immediately judge their killing effects against targets.

Currently, the developed countries of the world, such as the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany,
and Japan, are all paying a great deal of attention to the development of high-powered microwave weapons. Of these, the
United States’ and Russia’s high-powered microwave weapons have developed fairly fast and have undergone major
improvements. Early on in 1987, high-powered microwave weapons technology was listed as one of five key technical
projects in the US Department of Defense’s Balanced Technology Initiative (BTI) program. The space-based High-Power
Microwave (HPM) weapon that the United States is currently researching and developing is a weapon that kills targets on
the surface, in the air, and in space. It consists of a low earth orbit satellite constellation, and it can direct
ultra-wideband microwave energy at targets on the earth’s surface, in the air, and in space. Its effect is to produce a
high magnetic field over a scope of several dozen to up to a hundred meters in the target area, thereby destroying or
damaging any electronic components.

(3) Particle beam weapons

Particle beam weapons refer to directed energy weapons that use powerful, high-current subatomic beams to destroy
targets like aircraft, missiles, and satellites, or to render them ineffective. They are usually divided into two types:
charged particle beam weapons that are used in the atmosphere and neutral particle beams weapons that are used in outer
space. Particle beam weapons usually consist of a particle source, a particle accelerator, probes and aiming and
tracking, and a command and communications device.

The working principles of particle beam weapons are to use a powerful high-current accelerator that accelerates
electrons, protons, and ions produced by a particle source to near-light speeds and to use a magnetic field to focus
these into a dense particle beam flow that is shot toward the target. [The weapons] rely upon the many effects of the
particle beam flow to destroy the target or render it ineffective. There are largely three mechanisms by which particle
beams destroy targets or render them ineffective: the first is to damage their structure, the second is to cause
ammunition to explode early, and the third is to render electronic devices ineffective.

Particle beam weapons have the following distinct characteristics. First, their energy is highly concentrated, their
penetrating ability is strong, their firing power is great, and they can damage the internal structure of targets just
as kinetic energy weapons do, leading to an explosion in the ammunition of the target’s warhead and causing pulse
currents that leave electronic devices ineffective. Second, they can quickly change the direction of their firing and
can thus deal with multiple targets. Third, they can identify real and false targets. Neutral particle beams can
identify real and fake targets; this has an extremely important role in operations against missiles and against
satellites. Fourth, they are not affected by weather and the environment. Particle beams are not distorted by the
atmosphere nor are they affected by such things as clouds, so they are convenient to use.

Because particle beam weapons have great advantages and developmental prospects, some military powers are competing to
research and develop them, but they currently are still in an experimental stage. Early on in 1944, British scientists
conceived of using particle beams as weapons. As relevant technology developed, and given military needs, this research
work has still been ongoing since the 1990s. If the problem of the equipment’s excessive bulk is resolved, particle beam
weapons may in the future become an important space-based weapon.

# II. Soft kill weapons systems in space operations...119

Soft kill weapons systems in space operations refer to weapons and equipment systems that damage the optoelectronic
instruments in enemy space-based weapons systems, rendering them ineffective, or that use some other no-destructive
means to cause enemy space-based weapons system to lose their effectiveness in operations. In future space operations,
silent “soft confrontations” that leave no mark will make up an ever-growing proportion; soft kills cost less than hard
kills, they are relatively simple to carry out technologically, and they have the advantages where the scope of their
use is broad, the effectiveness of their operations is great, and they can avoid contaminating the outer environment
that is outer space. The weapons systems that are used in soft kills primarily consist of three types: low-powered
directed energy weapons, electronic warfare weapons, and network warfare weapons.

# 1. Low-powered directed energy weapons

Low-powered directed energy weapons are a type of directed energy weapon. They damage the fragile sensors and
optoelectronic systems of satellites, through firing lowpowered microwave beams, laser beams, and ion beams, thus
jamming and suppressing the ability of space-based weapons systems to work. For example low-energy laser and microwave
weapons and particle beam weapons are used to illuminate the enemy’s space operations weapons and equipment, damaging
their optoelectronic devices; although their entire structure is not damaged, they still lose their effectiveness in
operations.

Currently, space platforms primarily have two measures to resist attacks by low-powered directed energy weapons. The
first is to use new-materials technology to reinforce space platforms’ resistance to directed energy. This primarily is
the research and development of materials or paints that absorb, reflect, or disrupt directed energy beams; these
materials are used to manufacture certain parts that would be damaged by directed energy. Or a layer of paint that
covers the outer surface of space platforms can reduce in an effective way the destructive effects of beam energy
weapons. Currently, electromagnetic protective materials and laser protective materials have already been researched and
developed and have become relatively mature. Electromagnetic protective materials primarily consist of electromagnetic
shielding fabrics, electromagnetic shielding paints, electromagnetic wave-absorbent paints, nanometer-level metallic
powders, and the like; these kinds of electromagnetic protective materials have become widely used in the military
sphere. Laser protective materials primarily consist of two types: wavelength protection types and light intensity
protection types. The wavelengthtype protective materials use multiple layers of dielectric film, which have fairly good
reflective effects against lasers with certain wavelengths; light intensity-type protective materials use third-order
non-linear optical effects or heat-induced phased transformation mechanisms to protect against lasers. Laser protective
materials have already been applied in certain space-based weapons systems; for example, heat-induced phased
transformation materials that were successfully researched and developed by the United States’ Westinghouse Electric
Company have been used to protect infrared probes on satellites from being damaged by lasers. The second [measure] is to
use innovative technology to convert various kinds of sensors on space platforms; this kind of technology is represented
by the “eyelid” system developed by the United States’ MCNC Company. This kind of “eyelid” is manufactured from a piece
of thin glass; the upper part covers two transparent electrodes made of indium oxide and tin, and the electrodes are
connected by a non-transparent electrode similar to a hinge. By adding reverse voltage between the two electrodes, the
non-transparent electrode is pulled down under the effect of electrostatic attraction, so that the “eyelid” closes; by
changing the direction of this voltage, the “eyelid” opens. This “eyelid’s” opening and closing can reach 4,000 times a
second. This technology’s application to satellites’ optoelectronic sensors can prevent optical sensors being blinded by
lasers.

# 2. Electronic warfare weapons

Electronic warfare weapons are the sum total of the various types of weapons and equipment that jam and deceive
space-based platforms. In order to carry out electronic jamming against space-based weapons systems, electronic warfare
weapons primarily use a suppressive form of jamming, that is, they use very powerful jamming signals to push the
traveling-wave tube amplifiers or the solid state power amplifiers in space platforms transponders into power
saturation, so that they produce the so-called “power robbing” phenomenon. The jamming signal produces effective
suppression of normal signals, thus affecting and even blocking normal communications. For example, jamming of the
global satellite navigation and positioning system causes the opponent to have no way to correctly receive navigation
and positioning information, and jamming of communications satellites interrupts the opponent’s communications links,
keeping him from transmitting information. In addition, it is also possible to send deceptive signals to navigation and
positioning systems, so that the opponent mistakenly treats false information as correct navigation signals; this
similarly can achieve the goal of damaging the system’s operational effectiveness.

With regard to suppressive-style jamming by electronic warfare weapons, the combat methods that can be adopted consist
of improving space platform transponders and using nulling antenna technology and spread spectrum technology.
Improvements to transponders primarily consist of installing hard/soft limiters to the transponders or adopting
automatic gain control. Limiters and gain control technology can restrain highpowered jamming signals fired at space
platforms, reducing the power that passes through the transponders, but simultaneously without affecting the passage of
useful signals. Currently, the US military’s military satellite transponders basically have limit controls {xianfu
kongzhi}. Nulling antenna technology is technology for resisting jamming that is based on spatial filtering; this
technology goes through a combination of multiple antennas, and the received signal goes through adaptive weighing,
forming a null point for beams, and it can automatically align the null point with the direction of the jamming source.
This anti-jamming technology can be used to resist any type of electronic jamming; at the same time, it can also achieve
a fairly low signals interception rate. Spread spectrum is the most important technology for resisting jamming in
military communications; and it is also widely applied in satellite communications resistance to jamming. After using
spread spectrum technology, the power of regular signals will be several dozen times greater than that of jamming
signals under conditions where they are at the same distance; in order for the ground receiver’s output terminal to get
a jammingto-signal ratio of 1:1, the jamming signal’s power must be thousands or up to ten thousand times greater than
the signal power. It is very evident that using spread spectrum technology to enhance the anti-jamming capabilities of
space-based weapons systems is extremely effective.

# 3. Network warfare weapons

Network warfare weapons refer to the sum total of the various types of weapons and equipment that are used to carry out
network reconnoitering and damage to enemy spacebased weapons’ information systems. There are primarily two kinds of
network attacks against space-based weapons systems. The first is to get data chaining parameters and communications
protocols by deciphering satellite signals and to inject viruses, logic bombs, and false information signals into the
opponent’s information system by means of his data chaining, thus creating malfunctions in the satellite information
system or thoroughly paralyzing it. The second is to conceal computer viruses in computers in the opponent’s satellite
information system in advance by means of covert channels and to activate the viruses when necessary, thus damaging the
opponent’s information system. This means of soft attack is not limited by time, area, or weather conditions, and it has
the nature of being random, covert, sudden, long-term, extensive, and calamitous; it not only can steal important
information in the enemy’s space operations weapons and equipment system, but it also can “paralyze” the opponent’s
entire spaceflight system.

There are primarily four methods for resisting attacks by network warfare weapons. The first is to carefully monitor
signals from the space platforms. By means of comprehensive monitoring and a monitoring system, monitor uploaded and
downloaded signals for the space platforms at all times, so as to promptly find and track suspicious signals and to

analyze the direction, power, and contents of the suspicious signals, and to launch a counterattack when necessary. The
second [method] is adopt information identification technology within the satellite information system, in order to
automatically distinguish illegal information, information containing viruses, and false information, and to carry out
prompts [about these], refuse to transmit them, and refuse to process them. The third is to carry out careful and
detailed examination of information systems on the satellite prior to the satellite’s launch. It is particularly
necessary to examine the security and reliability of parts, [to see] whether there are leaks and back doors. The fourth
is to use legal means for an effective attack against “satellite hackers.” The main thing is to draft and stringently
execute laws related to satellite information security, and to carry out prevention, deterrence, and punishment against
“satellite hackers,” while at the same time strengthening international cooperation and joining international strengths
in attacks against international organizations’ or individuals’ network attacks against satellites.

# Section 5: Ground Systems for Applications and Management of Space Resources...122

Ground systems for applications and management of space resources usually refer to various types of command and control
systems that have been established on the ground and that are responsible for receiving, processing, and distributing
information. Ground systems for applications and management of space resources are linked with other subsystems by means
of the satellite operations control network, and they quickly provide users with the data and information products that
the spacecraft and ground receiving and processing systems collect and produce, so as to manage and share space
resources in an effective manner and to improve the applications effectiveness of space strengths’ support to joint
operations command systems. Here we will focus on explaining the ground applications system for satellite
reconnaissance, the ground applications system for satellite communications, and the ground system for satellite
meteorological monitoring and forecasting.

# I. Ground applications system for satellite reconnaissance...122

There are a fairly large number of types of reconnaissance satellites; their ground applications systems vary, but in
general, they can be divided into two categories, that is, geostationary satellite ground applications systems and near
earth orbit satellite ground applications systems. Because the effective payloads that reconnaissance satellites carry
differ, the missions of their ground applications systems also vary.

Geostationary reconnaissance satellites’ ground applications systems are similar in form to those of satellite
communications earth stations; where they differ is that what they receive is satellite remote sensing data. The amount
of data is great, and its transmission rate requirements are high. The ground applications systems of satellites in near
earth orbit require setting up a certain number of ground collection stations, because the satellites’ locations are
constantly changing, in order to get as much data as possible, and [these stations] subsequently transmit the data to a
data processing center. Of course, countries with relay satellites can transfer the reconnaissance data to ground
stations via geostationary relay satellites; in this way, there is no difference between their ground applications
systems and the ground applications systems of geostationary reconnaissance satellites. Return-type reconnaissance
satellites do not have ground receiving systems. Another important function of ground applications systems is
professional control over satellites. Control management of satellites also can be divided into two categories. One
category is engineering control, which primarily does orbital control and attitudinal control for satellites, with the
goal of ensuring that satellites work normally. The other category is professional control, which mainly controls the
working status of satellites, that is, it manages the effective payloads that satellites carry, such as control over the
times and places that cameras on photoreconnaissance satellites will photograph. These two types of control can be
carried out in tandem, done in a unified manner by a single ground control center of control station; they can also be
carried out separately by a ground control center and a satellite users’ ground applications system.

Satellite reconnaissance ground applications systems largely include the following subsystems: satellite ground stations
systems, satellite applications management centers, and satellite data applications systems. Satellite ground stations
primarily are composed of receiving antennas, remote control antennas, terminal equipment, computers, and power systems.
Their main tasks include precision tracking and monitoring of satellites; receiving the remote sensing and telemetry
data sent by satellites; processing to a certain extent the data that they receive and then transmitting these to the
management center; in accordance with the center’s instructions, exercising professional control over the satellites,
sending remote control instructions and examining how these are being carried out; and completing other tasks as
assigned by the control center. The satellite applications management centers are the command hubs for reconnaissance
satellites; they control the satellites in completing their various designated tasks. They primarily consist of computer
systems; imagery data processing systems; data transmission systems; analysis, decision-making, and control systems;
communications systems; and power systems. Their primary tasks are to summarize the remote sensing data sent by ground
stations and to process these; to display task requirements, calculate control data for satellites, and transmit the
control commands to ground stations; and to analyze satellite data, provide opinions and proposals to decision-making
departments, and coordinate engineering control over satellites with the control centers and control stations that are
responsible for engineering control over satellites, so as to ensure that satellites operate normally. The main tasks of
satellite data applications systems are to transform satellite data into the final results, such as imagery,
photography, and maps; to transmit the final results of the satellites to relevant users; to set up satellite
information and data and to collect and sort out satellite data; and to produce products to be attached to the satellite
data.

# II. Satellite communications ground applications systems...123

Ground applications systems are an important component part of satellite communications systems. There are slight
differences among the ground applications systems of satellite communications that have various uses, but their basic
facilities are similar. Their main equipment is ground station devices that are used to transmit and receive
communications signals; they customarily are also called satellite communications earth stations, ground stations, or
terminal stations.

Satellite communications earth stations’ equipment generally can be broken down into six subsystems. The first is the
antenna subsystem. Earth stations generally use parabolic antennas; in addition to the antennas themselves, they also
include feeder devices (that deliver antenna signals to the tracking part) and tracking and driving devices (that
control the direction the antenna faces). Earth station antennas in the early period had apertures of ten to thirty
meters; because satellite technology has developed and ground systems have improved, antenna apertures have now been
greatly reduced. The second is the transmitting subsystem. This modulates the audio-frequency and video-frequency
signals to a carrier with a working waveband, and after a power amplifier amplifies them, they are transmitted to the
satellite through the antenna. The third is the receiving subsystem. This receives signals coming from the satellite,
and after it amplifies the detected wave, it retransmits it to the terminal system. The fourth is the terminal
subsystem. This consists of a carrier telephone terminal device, a television terminal device, a fax terminal device,
and a data terminal device. The fifth is the communications control subsystem. This is responsible for monitoring,
controlling, and periodic testing of the various devices within the earth station. The sixth is the power subsystem.
This is used to provide power for all of the earth station’s devices.

Based on work requirements, satellite communications earth stations can use differing frequencies and antenna apertures.
In order to facilitate production, use, management, and maintenance, the International Communications Satellite
Organization has stipulated six types of earth station planning standards. Standard A stations’ working frequencies are
to be $6 / 4$ gigahertz (uploading/downloading), their antenna apertures are to be twentyseven to thirty meters, and
they are to be suitable for transmitting high-density trunk-line telephone calls on more than 100 to 1,000 channels.
Standard B stations’ working

frequencies are to be $6 / 4$ , their antenna apertures are to be eleven to thirteen meters, and they are to be suitable
for transmitting telephone calls on less than 100 channels. Standard C stations’ functions are similar to Standard A
stations’, but their working frequencies are to be 14/11 gigahertz and their antenna apertures are to be sixteen to
eighteen meters. Standard D stations’ working frequencies are to be 6/4 gigahertz, the antenna apertures are to be 4.5
to 5 meters, they are to be inexpensive and easy to use, and they are to be suitable for communications lines
requirements for less than ten channels. Standard E stations’ working frequencies are to be 14/11 gigahertz, their
antenna apertures are to be 3.5 to 8 meters, and they are to be used for digitized communications with a channel rate of
sixty-four kilobits per second. Standard F stations are similar to Standard E stations, but their working frequencies
are to be $6 / 4$ gigahertz and their antenna apertures are to be five to seven meters. In accordance with the form in
which they are used, satellite communications earth stations can be divided into fixed stations, portable stations, and
mobile stations; their working frequencies and antenna apertures also can be differentiated in reference to
international standards.

# III. Ground systems for satellite meteorological monitoring and forecasting...124

Meteorological satellites’ ground applications systems are used to measure and control meteorological satellites, and to
receive and process their meteorological information. They consist of a data collection and control station {shuju
jieshou yu cekong zhan}, a data processing center, a data collection system {shuju souji xitong}, and a data use station
{shuju liyong zhan}.

The data collection and control station includes a receiving system, a control system, and communications devices. Polar
orbit meteorological satellite systems have many data collection and control stations, while geostationary
meteorological satellites only have one station. These primarily receive information measured by the meteorological
satellite’s remote sensors, the data that are transmitted via satellite are collected into platform remote sensing data,
along with the satellite’s own remote sensing data, after which this information is sent via communications equipment to
the data processing center. It also transmits to the meteorological satellite the remote control commands that are sent
by the satellite control center. In addition, geostationary meteorological satellites’ data collection and control
stations transmit to the meteorological satellites cloud images and weather facsimile images that have been sent from
the data processing center, based on the orders from the satellite control center for the satellites to carry out
tracking and measurements, and to send the data that have been measured to the data processing center.

The data control center consists of computers, peripherals, and corresponding software. It records and processes the
information sent from the data collection and control station, extracts various kinds of useful information, turns these
into various kinds of weather maps, and changes various kinds of observation data into meteorological data and
distributes these to users. In addition, this center also exercises monitoring and command and control over the entire
meteorological satellite system.

The data receiving system includes large numbers of automated environmental data collection stations set up on land, at
sea, and in the air. They are configured with differing sensors and can collect differing environmental data; after
these undergo sampling, encoding, and amplification, they are sent to the meteorological satellites. Each meteorological
satellite can collect data from a number of stations, and afterwards transfer these [data] to the data collection
station, and after these are again processed by the processing center, they are distributed to users.

The data use station is responsible for receiving the various cloud maps that the meteorological satellites send in
real-time, and provides them to relevant regions for their use. The data use stations that are normally used consist of
automated image transmission cloud map stations, which are used to receive the real-time low resolution virtual cloud
maps; high-resolution image transmission cloud map stations, which are used to receive high-resolution digitized cloud
maps sent from polar orbiting satellites; small-scale data stations, used to receive low-resolution virtual cloud maps
sent by geostationary satellites; and medium-scale data stations, used to receive high-resolution digitized cloud maps
or virtual facsimile cloud maps {moni chuanzhen yun tu} sent by geostationary satellites.

# Questions for Deliberation…125

1. What are the main systems for obtaining space information?
2. Describe the categories of satellite imaging reconnaissance systems.
3. Describe the types of satellite communications system.
4. What are the basic types of space operations weapons systems?

# Lecture 5 The Main Patterns of Space Operations…126

Space operations have a special operational space and weapons and equipment xitong systems, and their operational
patterns similarly have an extremely special quality. In the current phase, space operations mainly include two
form-states: the first involves providing military assisting support $\{ zhi yua n \}$ from outer space for land, naval,
and air operations; the second involves conducting attack activities from the land, sea surface, underwater, and air
against enemy spacecraft. Along with the further development of space technology, direct confrontations of spacecraft
unfolding in outer space will become a possibility. Current methods for classification of space operations patterns are
quite numerous, but fairly typical are the following: partitioned per the engagement space, they include the
“space-to-space confrontation battle,” “space-to-ground confrontation battle,” and “integrated space-land battle”
{tiandi yitizhan}; partitioned per the nature of attack and defense, they include space assisting support operations,
space offensive operations, and space defensive operations; partitioned per the weapons employed, they include missile
battles, satellite battles, and spacecraft battles; partitioned per the application level, they include strategic space
battles, campaign space battles, and tactical space battles; and so on. From the standpoint of operational missions and
goals, space operations can be partitioned into five patterns: space deterrence, space blockade operations, space strike
operations, space defensive operations, and space information assisting support operations.

# Section 1: Space Deterrence…126

Space deterrence signifies having powerful space forces as backing and threatening to use or actually using limited
space forces to awe and contain the opponent’s military activities. The goal of this activities pattern is to make a
show of strength combining deterrence and combat and conduct activity $\{ huo don g \}$ to create a favorable posture,
thus showing the real strength and resolve of the friendly space operations; generate doubt, fear, and wavering in the
enemy; force him to abandon his operational intention; control the operational scale and intensity, plus the operational
means; and thus achieve the goal of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting or with minimal fighting. Space
deterrence is like nuclear deterrence or conventional forces deterrence: they all are a form of military deterrence.
Since space deterrence in terms of use has a strategic quality, convenience, and controllability, it thus will become
the main form of military deterrence, and the frequency of its use will grow increasingly frequent. [end of page 126]

# I. Main activities of space deterrence…127

In order to enhance the deterrent effects, space deterrence when applied usually adopts the method of gradual
escalation, to constantly increase the degree of force in deterrence of the enemy. According to the sequence of
activities intensity from weak to strong, 4 types of activities can be differentiated: show of space strength, space
military exercises, disposition of space forces, and overawing space strike. These four types of activities are not at
all mutually exclusive; they can be simultaneously employed, or can be conducted without a strict priority, and must be
flexibly applied based on the current situation.

1. Show of space strength

In peaceful times and in the early stages of “crises,” since the status of enemy and friendly confrontation is not clear
or not present, the goal of space deterrence is only prevention, so it usually only requires a display of the presence
of friendly space strength in order to achieve the goal of deterrence. Show of space strength can exploit public media
such as TV stations, radio, computers, and newspapers and magazines to carry out public opinion propaganda and display
to a potential enemy the powerful strength possessed by the friendly space forces, so that the enemy dares not take a
risk in political respects, or take rash action in military respects. Show of space strength belongs to lowintensity
deterrent activities, generally is carried out to complement political and diplomatic struggle, and is mainly expressed
by conducting various types of space equipment tests. Advanced space equipment is the main embodiment of real strength
in space operations, and open or semi-open tests of certain important space equipment will employ the form of media
propaganda, display at exhibitions, and invitations to foreign military officers to be observers. These will
comprehensively reveal the achievements of friendly space strength building, display the powerful space operations
capabilities they possess, and thus deter a potential enemy. In the process of displaying space strength, [the friendly
side] should differentiate the situations and adopt different open methods. This means either thorough openness, so as
to fully display real strength to deter the enemy, or semi-openness, so that the enemy cannot size up the exact details
of the friendly forces, and thus has misgivings and does not dare to conduct rash activities.

# 2. Space military exercises

When a “crisis” escalates, and a show of space strength is no longer sufficient to deter the enemy, it will be necessary
to conduct space military exercises. Space military exercises are quasi-real-combat [quality] space deterrent activities
set against an imaginary enemy and real combat backdrop, and adopting computer simulation and live fire modes to carry
out mutual attack and defense. These activities have a clear goal and a strong directed

[focused] quality; they have a sharp confrontational quality and quasi-real-combat quality and thus are suitable to be
carried out in “crisis” times and in the preparation phase for military activities. According to the development of
military struggle circumstances, this will require conducting space military exercises of appropriate scale and
diversity of form, and having a real-combat backdrop. The goals lie in boosting the attack and defense and
assisting-support operational capabilities of the space forces, and in displaying to the enemy the current posture and
operational resolution of the friendly space forces, as well as transmitting to the enemy information on the war
preparations we already properly carried out, [end of page 127] and on our capability and resolve for gaining victory in
war — all to force the enemy to beat a retreat in the face of difficulties. Space military exercises have multiple
forms, including the following: organizing antiballistic-missile and anti-spacecraft exercises, sufficient to display
the real strength of the friendly side’s space and counter-space units, and make clear that we have the capability and
means to seize space dominance; organizing space strike exercises, sufficient to display the powerful strike might of
friendly space weapons and equipment, and make clear that we have the capability and means to directly strike at targets
in the enemy’s strategic depth; and organizing space information assisting support exercises, sufficient to display the
real-time or near-real-time battlefield-posture awareness capability possessed by the friendly space information
systems, and make clear the ability to effectively provide battlefield information assisting support to other
operational strengths.

# 3. Disposition of space forces

Once a crisis intensifies, when the possible enemy takes clear action in terms of real combat preparations, [we] should
immediately speed up readjustment of the disposition of the space forces, to boost the deterrent intensity. The
disposition of space forces is the force-strength differentiation and deployment carried out for the space operational
strengths, based on the missions and activities nature of the space operations. This activity belongs to medium- to
high-intensity deterrence; it is an effective method for enhancing the deterrent effects and also can create a favorable
posture for the friendly side to enter real combat within days. Setting the disposition of space forces requires
regarding them as an important part of the integrated-whole operational disposition of the next military activities, and
an important link in working out an approach in planning using mathematical and scientific methods, so as to correctly
deploy the friendly space forces, form local superiority over the enemy, create a posture for strategic attack, and thus
cause the enemy to abandon his war intention out of a sense of a “large enemy force bearing down on the border.” This
activity mainly has two forms: projection of space forces and readjustment of the space forces’ disposition. Of these,
projection of space forces signifies activities to send spacecraft into outer space and recover spacecraft from outer
space, so as to transport astronauts, weapons and equipment, and operational

materiel. This is the most important link in establishing the space operational disposition, and also is an important
prerequisite for the space forces’ entry into outer space and carrying out of the operational missions. The activities
for projection of space forces are specifically jointly conducted by the space launch, space flight, space telemetry,
tracking and control [TT&C], space equipment technical support, and base defense units; and based on the differences in
the projection goal and endpoint, they can be divided into upward projection and downward projection. Upward projection
signifies the space launch activity conducted by the space launch units and space flight units, under close
complementation by the TT&C units and support units, as well as the defense units. Its goal is to transport astronauts,
weapons and equipment, and operational materiel into outer space. Today, the world’s space-faring nations mainly employ
space launch vehicles [SLVs] as the means of space delivery, while the U.S. also uses space shuttles to implement
projection. Downward projection signifies the activity of retrieval of recoverable spacecraft — photoreconnaissance
satellites, space ships, space shuttles, and aerospace planes — carried out by the space flight units and TT&C units,
under complementation by the support units. Its goal is to see that the recoverable spacecraft, after fulfilling its
mission, safely returns to [end of page 128] the ground base. Readjustment of the disposition of space forces signifies,
on the basis of the space forces’ peacetime disposition, the use of contingency space launch, orbital maneuver, and
land, sea, and/or air maneuver, to swiftly readjust the structure and arrangement of the spacebased information net,
space-based firepower net, and ground base net, so that they are adapted to the needs and requirements of space
operations.

# 4. Overawing space strike

When the above 3 nonviolent deterrent modes are not sufficient to halt the enemy’s war intention, [we] should adopt
punitive strikes, to warn the enemy that we have already properly carried out all-around war preparations, and will
spare no costs to safeguard the interests of the state. Overawing space strike is the highest form and final means of
space deterrence, and is the final effort made to realize the goal of deterrence when other means of space deterrence
are ineffective. It belongs to the real-combat [quality] space deterrence activities. The execution of overawing space
strike can adopt two forms: “soft strike” and “hard strike.” “Soft strike” signifies employing the space forces to
execute information attacks on the enemy, and in the electromagnetic [EM]-spectrum field, to jam and suppress or deceive
and confuse the enemy’s information acquisition, transmission, and command and control [C2] systems, so as to cause
radar blindness, communication interrupts, and C2 dysfunction on the enemy side. In the information network field, the
space forces will execute cyber attacks on the enemy, sabotage various types of enemy military-civilian information
networks, render various types of networks unable to normally operate, make the enemy fully feel our powerful cyber
operational capability, and thus add to the enemy’s doubts about adopting military activities. “Hard strike” signifies
employing the space forces to execute surprise, swift, limited-scale, overawing strikes against susceptible positions in
the enemy operational system of systems [SoS], to shake the enemy decision-makers psychologically, and force them to
dare not adopt large-scale military activities, or force them to sign a “[peace] treaty made under coercion,” in view of
the might of our space forces.

# II. Basic requirements for space deterrence…129

Space deterrence serves as a relatively flexible activities pattern. Within military struggle, it has a special position
and role, and its proper application will bring into play special effects which other activities patterns do not have.
[We] should tightly center on the links of employing deterrent forces, unfolding deterrent activities, displaying
deterrent resolve, transmitting deterrent information, and realizing the objectives of deterrence; accurately grasp the
key points of deterrence; control the intensity and tempo of the deterrence; synthetically apply the 4 deterrent
activities; and carefully organize and conduct the space deterrence, to achieve the optimum deterrent effects.

1. Focusing on the overall situation, for cautious decision-making

This is the most important principle in carrying out space deterrence, and is a fundamental assurance of achieving the
fixed military and political goals. Space deterrence is important content in the state’s military deterrence; it must
focus on the strategic overall situation, [end of page 129] comprehensively consider the state’s needs and requirements
in political, economic, and diplomatic respects, and adopt the appropriate activities, in order to deter the enemy, and
achieve the goal of gaining victory without a battle or with only a small battle. At the same time, space deterrence is
a relatively complex military activity. In the face of a sharp conflict of interests between the opposing sides, various
contradictions are woven together in an intricate and complex manner, and within this, besides the known and
quantifiable factors, there are also a good many unknown and unquantifiable factors. For example, the psychological
effects and degree of influence brought about by deterrent activities, the subjective dynamic quality of the men, the
fortuity in the deterrence process, and in particular the intangible factor of the ruses and stratagems applied by the
opposing sides — all these cause the deterrent activities to involve extremely complex situations. If these situations
are not well grasped, it could lead to failure of the deterrence, and then set off a war or an escalation of war. Hence,
in carrying out space deterrence, [we] must occupy the high ground of the overall situation in respect to the
formulation of tactics, the commitment of forces, the selection of the object [of deterrence], the establishment of the
scope, the achievement of the objectives, and the employment of means and modes — and thus carefully use

mathematical and scientific methods, act with caution, and strive to bring into play to the maximum extent the
effectiveness of deterrence, and thus achieve the anticipated goal. [We] should comprehensively consider needs and
requirements plus possibilities, and on the basis of all-around analysis and weighing of the advantages and
disadvantages, carry out cautious decision-making. The needs and requirements of space deterrence are mainly expressed
in three respects: first are the needs and requirements of military struggle. Relative to real combat, deterrence is a
military activity of both lower risk and lower cost. Only when the deterrence fails or in situations where there is no
alternative can real combat means be employed. Next are the needs and requirements of political struggle. Space
deterrence similarly is in the service of political struggle and is one of the means for achieving political goals. The
more pressing the needs and requirements of politics for space deterrence, the clearer will be its objectives, and the
more distinct will be its role. Third are the needs and requirements of diplomatic and economic struggle. Within
economic and diplomatic struggle bearing on the immediate or vital interests of the state and the nation, when
diplomatic avenues cannot achieve or have difficulty achieving a certain goal, conducting military deterrence, including
space deterrence, often is an important choice for decision-makers. On the basis of needs and requirements, the conduct
of space deterrence always must consider what is possible, mainly in 3 respects: first is the need to have certain
convincing space deterrent strength. This is because in any situation, if [we] ourselves do not have real strength, or
if the strength is insufficient, we will never be capable of deterring the enemy. Second is the need to have the resolve
to “intimidate the enemy.” If [we] lack firm resolve and strong will, the role of deterrence will be a pale and weak
one. Third is the need to have a good environment for achieving the goal of space deterrence. The talent of the
decision-makers and the morale of the officers both are important factors deciding the success or failure of space
deterrence.

2. Controlling the tempo, and striving for the initiative

Space deterrence serves as one means of military struggle, and it requires altering the adversary’s psychological
mindset in order to play its role. Compared to operational activities, it requires an even stricter grasp of the tempo
of the activities; otherwise, the activities could lead to failure of the deterrence and loss of the initiative. To this
end, in the course of carrying out space deterrence, [end of page 130] [we] must be able to examine the time to measure
the circumstances, act according to the circumstances, be flexible and changeable, and from start to finish seize the
initiative in the struggle with the enemy. This mainly involves fully grasping 4 points: first is rational determination
of the intensity of space deterrence. If the deterrent intensity is too high, the adversary will have difficulty
accepting it, and may rush ahead into danger; and if the deterrent intensity is too low, [we] cannot make the adversary
feel the pressure, so it will be difficult to play a deterrent role. Hence, the intensity of the deterrence must be
moderate; the key points will be leaving the adversary leeway to come to terms and make concessions, to prevent an
escalation of the confrontation caused by the adversary not having an out. Second is a precise grasp of the timing for
carrying out space deterrence. Deterrent activities which are too early will reveal the friendly side’s strategic
intent, and lead to passivity in strategic terms; deterrent activities which are too delayed may mean losing the optimum
opportunity for combat and inability to achieve the deterrent effects. Third is a timely evaluation appraisal of the
space deterrence effects, so as to adjust the deterrent tactics at the right time. After the friendly side conducts
space deterrence, it should adopt a variety of means to timely collect and arrange intelligence on the enemy’s reaction
and evaluate the effects of the deterrence. If the adversary’s reaction makes clear that the degree of force in the
deterrence is insufficient, then the friendly side should in good time increase the degree of force in the deterrence;
and if the adversary’s reaction makes clear that the degree of force in the deterrence is too high, then the friendly
side should consider suitably decreasing the degree of force in the deterrence. In situations where the adversary has
already shown signs of launching space operations or where space operations have already escalated, clearly indicating
that the deterrence has failed, the friendly side should immediately and fully carry out preparations for meeting the
adversary head on. Fourth is flexible handling of the various situations over the course of space deterrence. In the
process of application of deterrence, [the friendly side] must swiftly and resolutely handle all unexpected situations
which temporarily arise, so as to maintain the initiative within the space deterrence activities.

3. Unified activities, for integrated-whole deterrence of the enemy

Space deterrence is an integrated-whole confrontation of the opposing sides’ comprehensive real strength. Only via
unified activities, and truly doing a good job of adjusting-coordination and complementation of multiple forms of
deterrence, with synthetic application of a variety of deterrent means, can [we] realize an organic combination of
deterrent strength, resolve, and information; form integrated-whole effects with the space deterrence; and achieve
control while not being controlled. First are unified activities. All forces which participate in space deterrence
should be cohesively joined in all respects at the periphery of the supreme decision-making level, which should put into
effect centralized unified leadership, to ensure in fundamental terms the consistent adjusting-coordination of
operational activities. Next is the adjustingcoordination and complementation of multiple forms of deterrence. Under
informationized conditions, the diversity and complexity of threats and conflicts have decided that military deterrence
by a single means or a single avenue will have increasing difficulty in forming effective deterrence of the enemy. Only
when space deterrence is combined with deterrent forms such as nuclear deterrence and conventional forces deterrence,
and at the same time complemented by struggle in the political, economic,

and diplomatic fields, so that all forms of deterrence benefit by mutual association, can the effectiveness of
deterrence be brought into play to the maximum extent. Third is the tight combination of all means of deterrence. In
view of the different environments and different objects [of deterrence], [we] should combine attack with defense and
see that the false and the true aid one another, to form integrated-whole deterrent effects, and thus firmly seize the
initiative in space deterrence, so that the enemy cannot but believe in our operational resolution, real strength, and
capability, [end of page 131] and so must believe in them and dares not believe otherwise.

4. Having preparations in advance and keeping grounded in real combat

Preparedness ensures success, and unpreparedness spells failure. Due to the complex and changeable situations facing
space deterrence, the possibility of failure is present from start to finish. Only by moving up and fully carrying out
all preparations for meeting the enemy head on, can [we] swiftly shift into space operations status once the deterrence
fails, or deal with an escalating situation in space operations, and fight and defeat the enemy. At the same time,
deterrence is something having real combat as its basis. Speaking in fundamental terms, precisely because the real
combat application of space forces can force the adversary to pay a huge price, it thus can play a role in deterrence.
The stronger the real combat capability, the larger will be its role in deterrence. Hence, when carrying out space
deterrence, the fuller the preparations for meeting the enemy head on, the higher will be the dependability in defeating
the adversary, the more effective will be the deterrent activities, and the higher will be the possibility of success in
the deterrence. By contrast, that kind of deterrence or intimidation which is purely an empty show of strength not only
will have difficulty playing a deterrent role, but sometimes even may produce just the opposite result. In properly
carrying out the preparations for space operations, the key points are to set out from the most complex and most
difficult situations, and formulate a variety of contingency courses of action [COAs], to ensure that when needed, [we]
will be able to swiftly shift from a deterrent status to real combat status.

# Section 2: Space Blockade Operations…132

Space blockade operations signify operational activities conducted by space forces alone, or under assisting support and
complementation by other services and arms, in order to stop enemy space forces from entering outer space and orbital
maneuver, as well as to exchange information with ground systems. Entering outer space and carrying out orbital maneuver
plus effective transmission of information are basic prerequisites for the space forces to carry out their missions, and
space blockade can make the enemy partially or completely lose this capability. Hence, in operations under future
informationized

conditions, space blockade operations will serve as one of the basic patterns for seizure of space dominance and will
penetrate space operations from start to finish.

# I. Main activities of space blockade operations…132

Based on the differences in the blockade area (zone), space blockade operations can be divided into 4 types of
operations: blockade of a space base, orbital blockade, launch path blockade, and information blockade. The activities
of these types of blockades not only can be independently adopted, but also synthetically adopted, to enhance the
blockade effects.

# 1. Blockade of a space base

This signifies operational activities in which space forces, under assisting support and complementation by other
services and arms, apply various types of firepower and information weapons to attack or jam an enemy ground space
launch base. Space bases are [end of page 132] fundamental supports $\{ yit u o \}$ for space forces, and even though
spacecraft autonomous operating capability will be constantly enhanced along with the full-speed development of space
technology, operations by space forces nonetheless still will highly rely on ground bases to provide them with various
types of assisting support. Strikes to sabotage enemy space bases, so that they cannot operate normally, thus will be
able to effectively stop the enemy’s transportation of personnel, equipment, weapons, munitions, and energy fuel into
outer space, and thus maximally weaken and even disintegrate the enemy space forces’ capability for sustained
operations. At the same time, since space bases and their subsidiary installations usually occupy large surface areas,
have relatively fixed locations, involve huge complex systems, have distinct target features and weaker protection
capability, and moreover are difficult to restore within a short time after suffering a strike, blockading an enemy
space base thus not only enables sabotage of the enemy space launch capability, but also enables destruction of the
enemy’s various types of spacecraft situated on the ground and produces the effects of ripping up the ground from under
the enemy’s feet and yielding twice the result with half the effort. In order to boost the effects of blockade of an
enemy space base, [we] should synthetically apply the fighting methods of force-strength harassing attack, fire strike,
and information jamming. Force-strength harassing attack means dispatching special operations forces [SOF] to infiltrate
from the air or ground into an enemy space base, and adopt the surprise-raid mode to sabotage the base’s
critical-quality space installations such as its C2 center, launch towers, and TT&C radar, as well as infrastructure,
such as

the electric power support $\{ bao zha n g \} ,$ 10 fuel injection, and communication support systems, in order to delay
or sabotage the enemy space launch activity within a fairly short time. Fire strike means the application of space
forces, as well as the long-range precision strike forces of other services and arms, to execute continuous, fierce fire
strikes against an enemy space base. The key points are on sabotaging the spacecraft, SLVs, launchers, and various
auxiliary installations situated within the base; killing the base’s effective strength; and thus within a fairly short
time paralyzing the enemy space base, and stripping away its space launch capability. Information jamming means the
application of cyber warfare and electronic warfare [EW] means to sabotage the enemy space base’s C2 net, and suppress
and jam the enemy space measurement and control signals, so that the enemy space base cannot effectively fulfill its
launch missions.

2. Orbital blockade

This signifies operational activities to lay obstacles in the enemy spacecraft’s operating orbit and its adjacent areas
(zones), so as to block or sabotage the enemy spacecraft’s inorbit operation and orbital maneuver. Each and every
spacecraft executing a mission in outer space has its relatively stable operating orbit. Since this orbit’s parameters
are fairly easily acquired via technical means, added to which is that outer space is an open space, the outcome is that
implementation of orbital blockade is convenient and fast. Two methods can be adopted to implement the orbital blockade:
orbital interception and orbital obstacle setup. Orbital interception is the use of anti-spacecraft weapons, in entity
destruction mode, to directly destroy enemy spacecraft operating in orbit, or in incapacitating mode, to cause them to
partially or even completely lose operating capability. Due to the differences in operational capability of various
types of antisatellite [ASAT] weapons, and the mutual differences in the classes and nature of the strike objectives,
[we] thus should thoroughly adjust-coordinate the interception activities of the various ASAT weapons, to boost [end of
page 133] the interception effectiveness, and as much as possible reduce the accidental damage to friendly spacecraft.
Orbital obstacle setup is the laying of obstacles — space mines and space debris — in the operating orbits and adjacent
areas (zones) of enemy spacecraft, so as to threaten the spacecraft in collision or blocking/blast mode, and thus limit
its normal operation and orbital maneuver. Laying obstacles in space orbits is simple and easy to realize, and has
fairly low cost, with fairly good blockade effects. However, the presence of large quantities of space obstacles, and in
particular the inability to distinguish friend from foe with some obstacles (such as space debris), not only can
constitute threats to enemy spacecraft, but also may imperil the security of our side’s spacecraft and those of neutral
states. Hence, when organizing and implementing an orbital obstacle blockade, [we] must analyze the space battlefield
posture in an all-around and careful way, and as much as possible reduce the blockade area (zone), so as to boost the
directed [focused] quality. In order to avoid “self-blockade” or setting off an international dispute, the obstacles are
usually only laid in an enemy space orbit or in a $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } } -$ party space orbit used by the enemy, and
are generally not laid in orbital areas (zones) shared by the enemy and friendly sides and neutral states.

# 3. Launch path blockade

This signifies the use of a space-based anti-spacecraft weapon or meteorological weapon to control an enemy space launch
path, intercept an enemy SLV taking off from the ground but not yet entering orbit, and stop the enemy space forces’
operational activities involved in entering a mission orbit. Due to the restrictions of a space base’s geographic
conditions and the SLVs, as well as the spacecraft mission orbit, a spacecraft’s launch into orbit must use a specific
launch path. Hence, controlling an enemy spacecraft’s launch path enables effectively stopping the enemy space forces
from entering the predetermined orbit. Blockade of a launch path can adopt two modes: closing of a “launch window” and
exoatmospheric interception. On one hand, space launch activity is fairly highly influenced by meteorological
conditions, and if the minimum meteorological conditions permitting a launch are exceeded, successful launch of the
spacecraft cannot be ensured. Hence, via thorough space reconnaissance, accurate grasp of the situation of progress in
the enemy space launch preparations work and of the meteorological situation in the launch area (zone), timely
employment of meteorological weapons to alter the local meteorological conditions present in the area of the space base,
and closing of the enemy’s “launch window,” [we] can block or sabotage the enemy space launch activity. On the other
hand, before an SLV has risen into the atmosphere to insert the spacecraft into orbit, since the spacecraft has still
not separated from the SLV, the SLV thus will have a fairly slow speed and form a fairly large target, with distinct
features; it will be extremely susceptible to interception by an anti-spacecraft weapon. At such a time, the use of
space-based directed energy weapons [DEWs] and kinetic energy weapons [KEWs] to effect interception of an enemy
spacecraft before insertion into orbit can effectively stop its entry into the predetermined orbit or lower its
orbital-entry precision. Organizing of exoatmospheric interception is extremely complex; it not only requires timely
detection of enemy space launch activity, and thus accurate interception data provided to the anti-spacecraft weapon
system, but also requires adopting flexible orbital disposition modes to realize multilevel coverage of the enemy space
launch path. [end of page 134]

4. Information blockade

This signifies synthetic application of a variety of information warfare [IW] means, to jam and sabotage the signal
communication among enemy spacecraft and between the spacecraft and the ground, blind electro-optic [E-O] reconnaissance
facilities equipment, jam navigation positioning signals, and thus isolate the operational activities of the information
contacts between the enemy ground [stations] and outer space. Information blockade mainly includes 3 modes: the first is
electronic jamming: i.e., the use of electronic and E-O jamming equipment and instrument equipment with a disposition on
the land, sea, air, and space battlefields, and adoption of nonlethal modes to disrupt the normal operation of the
electronic facilities equipment in the enemy space system, and sever the signal communication between the enemy’s
in-orbit spacecraft and the ground assisting support and safeguarding support systems {zhiyuan baozhang xitong} and
various types of user systems, as well as the signal communication among various spacecraft. By conducting electronic
jamming of the enemy space system’s space TT&C and command systems, as well as space-based information platforms and
spacecraft sensors, and severing their communication links, [we] not only can render the enemy spacecraft unable to
operate normally, but also can render the enemy spacecraft unable to provide effective information assisting support for
operational activities on the land, sea, and air battlefields. The second mode is cyber attack: i.e., the use of
computer virus and “hacker” intrusion modes to sabotage and even paralyze the enemy space system’s computer network. The
computer network is the core of the entire space system, and the acquisition, transmission, processing, storage, and
dissemination of various types of information all rely on this network. [This means] applying cyber attack forces and
adopting virus attack and “hacker” attack modes to conduct attack activities — information theft, tampering, deletion,
deception, and congestion — against the enemy space system’s computer network, so that it cannot normally operate, and
thus render the enemy’s space control system, weapons systems, and communication systems unable to operate normally. The
third mode is low-energy damage: i.e., the use of low-energy lasers, microwaves, and particle beams to attack the enemy
space system and damage it or cause it to fail, so that it loses the capability for providing information assisting
support to the land, sea, and air battlefields. Use of the low-energy damage mode produces direct and clear effects and
enables within a short time swiftly degrading and even stripping away the enemy’s capabilities for space information
acquisition and transmission; but the scope of destruction and sabotage is not easy to control, and this mode easily
causes sabotage to friendly or neutral-state information platforms operating in the same orbital area (zone). Hence,
attacks on enemy space-based platforms must be extremely careful, to avoid “fratricidal fighting” or triggering of an
international dispute.
