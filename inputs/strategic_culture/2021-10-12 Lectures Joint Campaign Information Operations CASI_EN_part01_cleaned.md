# PROJECT EVEREST The Department of Defense epicenter for human-centered strategic art

Project Everest is a strategy design start-up inspired by Andrew Marshall’s call to cultivate comprehensive
understanding of U.S. competitors in pursuit of national security. Project Everest contributes to this vision in two
fundamental ways: by recurrently educating defense professionals on adversaries’ ways of war and by facilitating the
development of novel strategies that achieve competitive advantage over potential adversaries. Founded in 2013, Project
Everest has grown its membership to hundreds, and shaped policy and education campaigns at the national level.

Project Everest tackles two significant national security problems for our nation. First, Project Everest seeks to
invigorate the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs’ 2013 charge to develop an officer cadre with deep regional expertise and to
answer the 2018 National Defense Strategy’s charge to “prioritize developing the intellectual firepower of our
warfighters and workforce via education and training”.

Second, we seek to inject creativity into stale strategy development methods for the Department of Defense, inspiring
novel approaches to competition and warfighting and answering the charge of the 2021 Interim National Security Strategic
Guidance to employ our “full diversity of talents [to] address today’s complex challenges” and “prevail in strategic
competition.” Traditional approaches to strategy development overlook opportunities to understand how a potential
adversary thinks about and plans for competition and war.

We bring together motivated individuals with subject-matter expertise in their primary specialty to interrogate key
strategic issues throughout their careers. Over time, this develops a cadre of high-caliber officers who have a deepened
appreciation of nearpeers’ ways of war and are experienced in thinking through the toughest operational and strategic
challenges. We believe human-centered design and unconventional problemsolving methodologies enable members to
assimilate new knowledge and develop novel warfighting concepts and recommendations to address strategic challenges.

Project Everest was founded by six graduates of the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, who range in gender,
expertise, rank, status, ethnicity, and personality, and who have a shared vision to inspire change in the way our
nation prepares to compete and fight.

# In Their Own Words

The “In Their Own Words” series is dedicated to translations of Chinese documents in order to help non-Mandarin speaking
audiences access and understand Chinese thinking. CASI would like to thank all of those involved in this effort.

In the “In Their Own Words” series, CASI and its collaborators aim to provide Chinese texts that illustrate thoughtful,
clearly articulated, authoritative foreign perspectives on approaches to warfare at the strategic, operational, and
tactical levels.

# Project Everest Comments

Lectures on Joint Campaign Information Operations is part of the Project Everest “Foreign Military Thought” series. This
particular volume was published under the auspices of Project Everest in conjunction with the China Aerospace Studies
Institute. Written by the PRC’s National Defense University (NDU) faculty, with assistance from the General Staff
Operations Department and the Academy of Military Sciences, this text contains instructional material for NDU
Commander’s Course, Staff Officer, and PLAwide Information Operations Advanced Studies Courses. Forward looking, and
deliberately very comprehensive on concepts of information operations at the campaign level in the joint form, the 2009
edition contains extensive review/revisions from its previous publications.

The U.S. editors apply a stringent vetting process to select foreign texts. Selected texts will help build a deep
understanding of different approaches to warfare and clarify details of foreign perspectives that may have both
commonalities and asymmetries to U.S. approaches. This series will stimulate thought on both the core elements of
military strategy and operational concepts for force application during war. CASI and Project Everest believe that
cultivating a holistic understanding of foreign perspectives by learning from high-quality original material articulated
from a foreign perspective offers an invaluable starting point for the exchange of ideas and the development of military
thought.

The translation and publication of Lectures on Joint Campaign Information Operations does not constitute approval by any
U.S. Government organization of the contents, inferences, findings and conclusions contained therein. Publication is
solely for the exchange and stimulation of ideas.

# Translators’ Notes

This translation of the original text aims to accurately capture the technical meanings, in both English and Chinese.
This will ensure that the reader will not inadvertently draw the wrong substantive understanding based on inaccurate
translations.

# Note on Trouble Terms:

Throughout the text are certain terms that are translated with the Chinese pinyin modifying the terms. This convention
allows the reader to distinguish nuances that exist in the Chinese terms.

Jihua and guihua plans. The jihua plan is a more specific plan, a plan that is meant to be carried out to the letter,
whereas the guihua plan is a more general plan that is macroscopically focused. In order to retain the intended Chinese
distinction, the jihua plan is rendered as “plan {jihua}” due to its prevalence in this translation. The guihua will be
rendered in a more customary fashion of guihua plan.

Bushi and bushu dispositions. Bushi disposition is the mission differentiation, organized grouping, and positioning
[deployment] accomplished for strengths within the campaign task-based organization. Bushi denotes the relationship
between one’s own military forces, the opponent’s military forces, and the combat environment (e.g., terrain). Bushu
disposition is the positioning of participating force-strengths for a fixed time and space on the basis of mission
differentiation and the organized grouping of campaign and in accordance with operational conditions and the enemy’s
possible activities.

Xitong, tixi, tizhi, and zhidu systems. The system $\{ xit ong \}$ is an elemental system, one that can operate on its
own. The tixi-system is similar conceptually to a System of Systems as often seen in systems engineering; in Chinese, a
tixi-system is understood to be composed of elemental systems {xitong} acting together as a larger whole. The
tizhisystem is a large-scale system, typically a national-scale system and understood to be formalized embodiment of a
zhidu-system. The zhidu-system describes a conformance system, one where all elements of that system conform to how that
system is defined.

# Preface

Joint campaign information operations [IO] are the series of operational activities adopted for seizing and maintaining
local information dominance of a joint campaign, and it is an important operational activity of the joint campaign. It
is normally implemented together with other operational activities, and it can even be sometimes independently
implemented. The manifested forms of joint campaign information operations mainly are: electronic warfare, network
warfare, intelligence warfare, psychological warfare, physical destruct warfare. Amongst these, electronic warfare and
network warfare are the main forms of IO. Joint campaign IO is an important component of a joint campaign and it has a
major effect on victory or defeat of a campaign. Therefore, strengthening the study of joint campaign IO from
theoretical and practical perspectives has a very important significance for improving PLA joint campaign IO capability
and gaining victory in a war under informationized conditions.

This lecture is guided by Mao Zedong’s military thought, Deng Xiaoping’s armed forces building thought in the new era,
Jiang Zemin’s defense and armed forces building thought, and Hu Jintao’s important discourse on defense and armed forces
building under new circumstances and it thoroughly implements the scientific development view; with the military
strategic concept of the new era as its unified grasp and with the Chinese PLA Joint Campaign Outline {中国人民解放军联合战役纲要
zhongguo renmin jiefangjun lianhe zhanyi gangyao} as its basis, it focuses on the characteristics and laws of local war
under informationized conditions; tightly combines PLA realities; it borrows from the effective methods of foreign IO in
recent period local wars; it emphasizes the study of joint campaign IO for the next 5-10 years in the following issues:
characteristics, guidance thought and operational principles, operational strengths, operational objectives, basic
fighting methods, operational preparations, operational implementation, command modes and adjusting-coordination and
control; operational support; [end of page 1] logistic support; equipment support; political work; a variety of
operational patterns of IO; operational effectiveness evaluations; training; and building $\{ jia nsh e \}$ . It strives
to establish a more robust joint campaign IO theoretical tixi system, and it provides a theoretical basis for organizing
and implementing IO and training by the joint campaign commander and his command organ.

During the course of writing this lecture, we received a high level of attention and enthusiastic support from the
concerned experts and leadership of the General Staff Operations Department $\{ zuo zha n \ b u \}$ , Electronic
Confrontation Department {dianzi duikang $b u \}$ , Academy of Military Science and National Defense University. We
consulted a large number of relevant writings and recent new research achievements in the joint campaign IO domain.
Serving as teaching material of used on a trial basis in classes such as the National Defense University’s Commanders
Course, Staff Officer and PLA-Wide Information Operations Advance Studies Courses, etc. we assimilated ideas and
recommendations from scholars and concerned experts; for this we wish to express our heartfelt appreciation.

Due to the limitations of the writing and composition member’s research levels, it was difficult to avoid inappropriate
parts in this set of teaching materials. We sincerely request our readership to make critiques and corrections.

# Chapter 1 Overview of Joint Campaign Information Operations…1

Following the swift development in information technology, information and combat weaponry combined with the platform to
produce information weaponry that can greatly increase the combat effectiveness of the weapon system and platform.
Information has a very significant place and effectiveness in wars and no war can separate from information. The
regional wars since the 80s in the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century indicated to the world that information
operations had become a new commanding ground to win victory in modern war, its place in modern war was increasing and
the constant in-depth theories on information operations following the implementation of wars had emerged at the right
moment.

# Section 1: Relevant Concepts in Joint Campaign Information Operations…1

Joint campaigns actually started entering into the war in Second World War. At that time, the major operational
activities on the battlefield were accomplished by a campaign force of military services such as the Army, Navy, and Air
Force. Following the constant development in information technology, operation space had also expanded and the original
traditional operation spaces on land, sea and air had been extended to the information space. In 1991, with the Gulf War
as the symbol, information had become the most important operation source in joint campaigns. Through information
attacking and defending operations, one can be in control of the joint campaign situation and the joint campaign had
emerged with a new operational activity that was the information operation. The implementation of regional wars under
the condition of information indicated that the emergence of information operations had expedited the development in
establishing the theory on information power and information operations with the goal of seizing the information power
control had become an important component of the joint campaign, so the seizing of control in information power meant
the seizing of initiative in joint campaigns.

In January 1999, the Chinese military officially issued the Guidelines for Chinese People’s Liberation Army Joint
Campaign and it was the first time the “information operation” was officially listed in the operational ordinance,
signifying that Chinese military joint campaign information operations theoretical research had entered into a new
development stage.

# I. Information operations…2

Information operations are a series of operational activities1 for seizing and maintaining control of information power.
That is a series of operational activities the opposing parties in the battlefield use through measures such as
electronic warfare and computer network warfare to take advantage and damage the enemy’s information and information
system and at the same time, protect one’s own information and information system in order to gain free power and
initiative in battlefield information. The measure and capability components of the information operations are the keys
to understanding the concept of information operations and each nation’s military has its own view and understanding.
The American military considers “information operations as operational activities that comprehensively utilize core
abilities such as electronic warfare, computer network warfare, psychological warfare, military deception, and
operations security for the purpose of influencing, damaging, interrupting and depriving the enemy’s man-made and
automatic decision-making capabilities, at the same time, protecting its own decision-making capability under the
coordination of specific support and relevant ability.”2 For the first time, in the 2006 edition’s Regulations of
American Military Joint Information Operations, the American military proposed that information operations included
three major capabilities and they were core capability, support capability, and relevant capability. Among them, the
information operations core capability included electronic warfare, psychological warfare, computer network warfare,
military deception, and operation security; information operations support capability included information safeguard,
entity security, entity attack, counter intelligence, and combat photography; information operations relevant capability
included public affairs, military-civilian relation activity, and national defense support in public diplomacy.

To have an understanding of information operations, one must mainly have a handle of the following points: (1) from the
purpose of operations, seizing the control of information power is the direct purpose of information operations. In the
modern military, each combat unit and each weapon system are coagulated to become one operational body through the
bonding action of the military information system and if it loses this bonding action, then the military becomes a plate
of loose sand. When the opposition’s information system is damaged, its operation initiative power is taken away; while
one’s own information system is protected, its combat force is increased several fold. Therefore, information operations
are combats developed surrounding the destruction and protection of the information system and the pursued goal of
information operations is to seize information superiority. (2) From the angle of the battlefield environment, the
battlefield mentioned here can either be a battlefield of an information war pattern, or a battlefield of an information
war pattern transitioned from a mechanized war pattern, or even a battlefield of a mechanized war pattern. (3) From the
angle of combat object, the enemy’s information system is the attack target in information operations. As an attack
method, an information operation is not to destroy the enemy’s effective strength; neither is it mainly to damage the
enemy’s military installation but to damage the military information system including the enemy’s information detection,
information transfer, information processing, and information control that these effective strengths and military
installations depend on to become effective. (4) From the angle of operation category, the basic categories of the
information operations are information operation reconnaissance, information attack, and information defense.
Information operation reconnaissance is mainly to reconnoiter the category, deployment, tactical and technical
performance, and operational application method of the enemy’s information system in order to provide intelligence
support for information attack and defense; at the same time, it also provides intelligence support to other actions in
the joint campaign. Information attack mainly interrupts the normal operation of the enemy’s information system through
all types of attacking methods. Information defense mainly secures the normal effectiveness of one’s own information
system through information security and information system protection. (5) From the angle of operational type,
electronic warfare and computer network warfare are the two major types of information operations.

Electronic warfare mainly interrupts the information collection and transmission of the opposition’s information system,
while computer network warfare mainly destroys the information processing and utilization of the opposition’s
information system. Through the comprehensive implementation of electronic warfare and computer network warfare that is
“computerized electronic integrated warfare {网电一体战 wangdian yiti zhan},” one can carry out an overall damage or break
down of the enemy’s information system. (6) From the angle of operational method, the basic methods of information
operations are electronic jamming, electronic deception, virus invasion, computer hacker attack, and anti-radiation
destruction and new mechanization information weapon attacks. Virus invasion and computer hacker attack use computer
networks to damage the enemy’s information processing and utilization. Anti-radiation destruction and new mechanization
information weapon attacks destroy the enemy’s information platforms and facilities using destructive weapons controlled
by information. (7) From the angle of operational activities, operations under information conditions are integrated
joint operations of various military services and are mainly indicated in an integrated campaign style of combining
various operational types and operational activities, which alter the planar and linear patterns on the battlefield in
the past and replace them with a multi-dimensional battlefield pattern that integrates land, sea, air, space, and
electromagnetic, thus, creating an integrated command information system, information weapon system using mainly
precision guided weapons, and electronic countermeasure system to appear and opening up a new operational domain. In
this domain, it finally develops into an information operational activity that is surrounding the seizing of the control
of information power due to mutual struggle between information attack and information safeguard. As an important
component in a joint campaign, the information operation is a series of operational activities developed to seize and
maintain control of information power during the campaign, acts as a lead from the beginning to the end, and is the key
to victory in joint operations. (8) From the position and effectiveness of information operations, the information operation must have organic integration with other operational activities to be effective.
The information operation has a profound position and effectiveness in the joint campaign; however, its effectiveness is
not all-powerful and it has to have organic integration with other operational activities to fully make use of its power
in war. From the angle of war patterns, current war patterns remain “mechanization $^ +$ information,” as information
operations do not reject mechanization operations, but use mechanization operations as the basis to increase
mechanization operational capability. From the angle of operational effectiveness, even though the position and
effectiveness of information operations in the war are getting more profound, the purpose of information operations is
mainly to damage the enemy’s information system and weapon control system and not to cause direct casualty and
destruction of the enemy’s military force and combat platforms. From the angle of operational capability, future
operations will be an overall combat capability confrontation composed of the mechanical force, defense force, precision
attacking capability, and information operation capability and the confrontation process is also the process of mutual
action among fire power, mechanical, protection, and information struggle. Information operations must combine with
lethality, maneuverability, and protection capability to really show their important value.

In conclusion, as an operation method, the information operation has a specific operational goal and operational target
and a special operational type and operational method, so one cannot consider information operations to be able to take
on everything in operations and one cannot also ignore the existence of information operations; instead, one must
organically combine information operations with other operational methods to form an overall operational capability.

# II. Informationized operations…5

As the basic representation form of informationized war, informationized operations {信息化作战 xinxi hua zuozhan} deeply
reflect the essential characteristics and working patterns of the informationized war.

Informationized operations utilize a large amount of information science and technology to form a command and control
system and are integrated operations with other informationized weapons and equipment as the basis; the military is
equipped with informationized operation capability within multi-dimensional space such as land, sea, air, space, and
electronic; and with joint operations and information operations as major operational forms. Informationized operations
is a term with special Chinese military characteristic as the foreign military does not have this term and the concept
is comparatively closer to the concept of “network centric warfare” and “rapid decisive operations” proposed by the
American military.

To specially indicate the battlefield confrontation format of the informationized war and to understand the essential
connotation of informationized operations, one must emphasize the handling of five aspects. (1) Epochal character.
Informationized operations are a product of the information age, high level stage of mechanization operation, and also
operational methods that are strictly different from mechanization operations. (2) Regularity. At least one side of the
engaging parties should have informationized operational capability that is also the main body of the troop combat
capability. The socalled informationized operational capability is the operational capability in which the troops use
informationized equipment to carry out early warning detection, command and control, precision attack, and information
countermeasures. It is a comprehensive operational capability that combines informational capability with lethality,
maneuverability, protection capability, and support capability. (3) Ideological content. In the operational ideology,
the prominence of mechanization operations is “platform centric warfare” that uses a large number of mechanized weapon
platforms as the basis in battlefield engagement and that is also the major force for gaining victory in the
battlefield. The prominence of informationized operations is “network centric warfare” that uses an integrated
battlefield informationized network facility of land, air, and space as the basic operational platform and also uses it
to communicate and form an integrated overall attacking force to win the victory in the battlefield. (4) Nature of time
and space. The major weapon and equipment of informationized operations is the integrated weapon and equipment of land
(sea), air, and space and its operational space includes the wide visible battlefield spaces such as ground, sea (under
water), air, and space and also includes the invisible spaces such as information, electromagnetic, and psychology. The
proportion of the operations being carried out in information space, cognitive space, and psychological space is
especially high. (5) Leading nature. The leading function of informationized operations is information and its focalized
expression is fire power and substance and the energy of maneuverability. Information not only is a type of operational
resource, but also a type of operational energy; at the same time, it is also an adhesive and multiplier of all sorts of
operational force and the dominant power to victory in operations.

As a basic operation form in informationized war, the informationized operation has the following differences compared
with the basic operation form of the mechanized operation in mechanization war.

On operational purpose, the informationized operation has changed the mechanized operation’s method of seizing
battlefield initiative by separately seizing air domination, sea supremacy, and land domination on the battlefield in
order to have a handle of the military force and fire power superiority in each battlefield space; instead, it uniformly
seizes the control of information power, uses information power to influence and restrain the initiative of other
battlefields, and thus masters information superiority in the battlefield that is to have a handle on the battlefield
real time sense control power, effective operational power of military force and fire power, and smooth operational
power of the battlefield service network as the major operational purposes.

On operational target, informationized operation has changed the mechanized operation’s operational target of using
mainly major engagement of forces and fire power fight to destroy the enemy’s effective strength and groups of large
number of forces in order to seize the battlefield space occupation power and strength superiority; instead, its major operational target is
to damage and break down the enemy’s battlefield “three major systems” – cognitive system, information system, and
command and control system; it concentrates on damaging the enemy’s informationized battlefield supporting facility and
operational basis and weakening and breaking down the enemy’s overall operational capability, and thus seizing the
battlefield initiative.

On operational form, the informationized operation has changed the mechanized operation’s unit-type battlefield contest
methods of land, sea, air unit battlefield, unit military service, and unit operational domain; instead, it depends on
the informationized battlefield and uses the overall contest among the operational systems consisting of the five major
sub-systems – battlefield cognitive system, information system, command and control system, attacking system (including
military strength and fire power), and support and safeguard system.

On operational method, the informationized operation has changed the mechanized operation’s operational method with
direct contact on a vast battle front and carrying out positional attack and defense struggle with assigned campaigns
and battles; instead, it uses the “three bodies in one” non-contact operation method consisting of land, air, and space
integrated information attack, long-distance precision guided attack on vital points, and large scale strategic air
raids.

On the mechanism of getting the upper hand, the informationized operation has changed the mechanized operation’s
mechanism of getting an upper hand in using superior numbers of military strength and overwhelming strength in fire
power; instead, it uses information superiority and superior control of information power to get an upper hand in the
battlefield. A superior information system has become the “binder” in binding each operational system, each operation
force and various types of weapons and equipment in the battlefield and also is the “multiplier” in leading and
manipulating operational forces in the battlefield; therefore, whoever gains information superiority in the battlefield
would also gain the initiatives in the battlefield such as air dominance, sea dominance, and electromagnetic dominance.

As a new operational form, the basic development tendency of the informationized operation is mainly indicated as
follows.

The battlefield strike has become quick. As precision-guided munitions and others become the major strike measures in
the battlefield, the striking speed of the informationized operation has greatly increased. Take the American military
as an example; currently, the required time to complete its “strike chain” from discovery, position, aim, attack, to
evaluation of the result took 100 minutes in the Gulf War, 40 minutes in the Kosovo War, 20 minutes in the Afghan War,
and merely 10 minutes in the Iraq War.

Operational activities have become precise. As highly efficient command information systems and precision-guided
munitions become major guided equipment in the battlefield, the development tendency of the informationized operation
has become precise. Prior to the Afghan War, the American military had a dispute between two operational theories and
the first one was a new war concept of “precision blitzkrieg” proposed by a group led by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld
and it was called “Rumsfeld theory.” The second one was the theory of “grand troop operation” proposed by a group led by
Secretary of State Powell and it was called “Powell” theory and its main operational idea was to deploy a large number
of ground troops, using army heavy divisions to carry out fighting action. The actual war proved that the “precision
war” theory in using small size, quickness, and precision to win victory of Rumsfeld was suitable for the actual
battlefield; at the same time, it also explains that precision action was the development trend of informationized
operations.

Operational procedure has become non-linear. Non-linear operations are an important trend of informationized operations
that is to adopt various flexible operational methods based on location, enemy, and situation. Its intention is to
attack operations and no longer to gradually “gnaw.” Instead, it is possible to directly fight in depth against the
enemy’s strategy or campaign. Defensive operation is also no longer point-by-point resistant “sustain.” Instead, it is
possible to deploy strike action against the enemy with the principal force. Counter procedures in operational
activities and the phenomenon of irregular “playing card” will occur often.

The battlefield environment has become transparent. The informationized battlefield is no longer operational space
composed of natural topography and simple ground fortifications; instead, it is an operational force and activity space
that uses manconstructed informationized network facilities as the basis, systems such as land, air and space integrated
reconnaissance, communication, command, control, and intelligence as the core, and the striking power of integrated
land, sea, air, space, and electronic dimensions as the main body. The “situation on the other side of the mountain” is
no longer a blurry picture in the informationized battlefield, but rather has a high level transparency. This high level
transparency has changed many uncertainties on the battlefield in the past and has made the targets much more clear and
action much more forceful in informationized operations.

# III. Joint campaign information operation…9

Regarding the concept of joint campaign information operation, the understanding in the academic world is still not
unanimous. Some considered: “Joint campaign information operation is a series of operational activities in a joint
campaign utilizing various types of information operational forces and also closely coordinating with other forces in
order to seize and maintain information superiority or control of information power in the battlefield.”3 Based on the above mentioned definition, Guidelines for Chinese People’s Liberation Army
Joint Campaign Information Operation further emphasized the distinct characteristic of information domain confrontation
and defined “joint campaign information operation” as “a series of operational activities to be carried out in order to
seize and maintain joint campaign regional control of information power and mainly in campaign information
confrontation.” Information operations create a major influence on the process and result of a joint campaign. On one
hand, information operations makes one’s own operation to be fully effective through seizing and maintaining information
superiority to speed up the joint campaign process and seize campaign victory by laying a firm foundation. On the other
hand, information operations cause the enemy to lose battlefield initiative and speed up the enemy’s failure through
seizing and maintaining information superiority. The effectiveness of the troop combat force as well as effective
implementation of operation command and control will mainly depend on the collection, transmission, handling, control,
and utilization of operation information. Joint campaign operational activities will be carried out surrounding the
seizing of information superiority, the struggle to seize control of information power on the battlefield will raise to
a profound position; as a major operational activity in joint campaign, information operations will be on the stage in
regional war under informationized conditions and be effective in a leading position.

The essential characteristics of joint campaign information operations are (1) the nature of large space and all
time-domain in operation scope. Development in military technology has made the operational space expand constantly.
Looking from the flat surface, long distance operation capability of military strength and weaponry has increased
unprecedentedly, operational reconnaissance can be carried out in the whole globe and the entire depth of the
battlefield, land (sea) weapon range and airplane operational radius have reached thousands of meters, and daily advance
speed of military strength maneuvering has reached several hundred thousand meters to greatly expand the operational
depth. Looking from the three-dimensional angle, high-tech weapons and equipment will spread out under water, on ground
(sea) surface, in air, and even in space, below water as deep as several hundred meters and millions of meters above in
space that constitutes a grand three-dimensional operation space and an integrated war in grand crisscross over air,
land, and sea and becomes an important characteristic of regional war under informationized conditions. Another
characteristic of informationized weaponry is a high level electronics and networking. At the same time information
technology has greatly increased the precision, power, and reaction capability of weapons and equipment, it also makes
them face the situation of electronic suppression, network attack, and destruction from anti-radiation and new
mechanization weapons. Joint campaign information operations certainly follow the informationization of weapons and
equipment to penetrate into each domain of the battlefield, its operational space is very broad, and it has clear
characteristics of all time domains. (2) The nature of all-depth in striking targets. The several recent regional wars
in the world have tentatively shown the inkling of information operations. During the American-Libyan conflict, the
American military carried out an overall jamming suppression on the Libyan major electronic facility in the scope of 200
thousand meters in front and 300 thousand meters in depth six minutes prior to attack, and thus opened up a safe path
for aviation troop penetration. In the beginning of the Gulf War, multi-national troops concentrated on information
operation interference force by carrying out strong interference against Iraqi communications and radar and using F-117
stealth planes and precision-guided weapons to destroy the telecommunication building in Baghdad and radar control
center 160 miles southwest of Baghdad to damage the Iraqi military command information system. During the Kosovo War,
multi-national troops first attacked the Yugoslavian military command and control center in Belgrade. From here we can
see that the procedure and target of regional war information operations under informationized conditions select the key
and fatal parts to strike a deadly blow by focusing on the operation overall situation, surrounding the requirement on
striking targets, and within the allowed space scope of the battlefield, which has an obvious difference from the front
to rear gradual attacking method of traditional campaign tactics. (3) The nature of segregation in the information
attack and defense main body. In the traditional operation form, an operation main body can carry out attack duty and
also defense duty or it sometimes carries out attack duty and sometimes defense duty. Information operations also
include information attack and information defense, but the attack mainly is the information attack activities of
interfering, attacking, or destroying the enemy’s information system and the defense mainly is the defensive activities
of countering enemy information reconnaissance, counter electronic interference, and counter destruction. Therefore,
joint campaign information operations are an information attack and defense operational form that consists of two
mutually independent operational main bodies that are carried out at the same time. This unique operational form has
formulated a uniformity in operational purpose as well as a contradiction in operational activities between the two main
bodies – attack and defense, as they not only must fight shoulder to shoulder to seize information superiority but also
closely coordinate with each other to prevent one’s own being interfered.

Joint campaign information operations are generally divided into such information operations as island attack campaign
information operations, joint fire power strike information operations, island blockade campaign information operations,
anti air raid campaign information operations, and border defense campaign information operations.

# Section 2: Main Measures of Joint Campaign Information Operations…12

Lenin pointed out that “an army cannot be in control of all fighting weapons and all fighting measures that the enemy
has owned or will possibly own and anyone will consider this to be foolish and even criminal.”4 Under the current situation, the informationized levels of our [China]
operational opponent or potential opponent is very high and in comparison with ours, our opponent’s information
operational capability is clearly more superior; therefore, our keys to seize joint campaign initiative are to
strengthen joint campaign information operational measure build-up and to accurately utilize every type of information
operational measure. Joint campaign information operation measures mainly include electronic warfare, network warfare,
and psychological warfare.

# I. Electronic warfare…12

Electronic warfare was a new type of operational method that started in the early $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century
and was widely applied in the Second World War. Following the swift development and wide application in the military
domain of electronic technology, electronic systems became an important pillar in supporting military operational
systems, especially in the late 80s of the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century; the position and effectiveness of
electronic warfare had further been raised. However, the definition on electronic warfare of all nations in the world is
not the same and the focus of their debate concentrated mainly on the scope covered by electronic warfare. For example,
the American military considers: “electronic warfare to be any military action that utilizes electromagnetic energy and
directed energy controlling the electromagnetic frequency spectrum to attack the enemy’s military.”5 The scope of this
definition is very broad that includes not only soft strike but also hard destruction; while the scope of definition on
electronic warfare of some other nations is comparatively narrower that is limited to only soft strike; for example, the
electronic warfare of the Russian military only includes electronic reconnaissance and electronic suppression action on
the enemy’s electronic equipment and systems, as well as electronic defense of one’s own electronic facilities.

Electronic warfare is electromagnetic struggle carried out by both opposing parties using electronic facilities or
equipment and the purpose is to degrade or destroy the enemy’s electronic facility effectiveness and at the same time,
safeguard one’s own electronic facilities to be fully effective. The future joint campaign battlefield will be an
electromagnetic battlefield that reaches multi-dimensional spaces and is highly dependent on electronic facilities. In
this battlefield, if it is not combined with electronic warfare measures, then it will be difficult for other
operational measures to be effective. Regional wars that erupted in the 90s of the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century,
such as the Gulf War and Kosovo War, sufficiently proved that electronic warfare had a very important meaning in seizing
air dominance, sea dominance, and even dominance of the entire joint campaign battlefield. Therefore, electronic warfare
will be one of the most important operational measures in the joint campaign battlefield of the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t }
}$ century and will play a decisive role in gaining victory in war.

Electronic warfare includes mainly electronic reconnaissance, electronic attack, and electronic defense.

# II. Network warfare…13

Network warfare is the sum total of various measures that one adopts in the computer network space by taking advantage
of the security flaws of the enemy’s network system to invade the enemy’s computer network to steal, falsify, or damage
the enemy’s information and to decrease and damage the operational effectiveness of the enemy’s computer networks; and
at the same time, protect the security of one’s own computer network for normal effectiveness.

After computer networks, which were developed in a short several decades, were applied to the military domain, the
network space had become another brand new battlefield in military struggle. As a new operational method, network
warfare has truly accomplished integrating the functions of single command, information sharing, timely discovery, and
real-time destruction in the joint campaign battlefield; at the same time, following the constant increase of
informationized levels in the battlefield, computer network warfare has also become an important component in
information warfare and ha been an important operation measure in seizing and maintaining control of information power
in the battlefield. Network warfare is a double-point sword with two-sidedness as it is an important measure for strong
nations to pursue the important measure of “defeating the opposition’s military without fighting” and also an effective
way for a weak nation to carry out an asymmetrical operation against a strong nation. The Kosovo War in 1999 was network
warfare with real meaning in human history. During the war, even though NATO had air superiority and invaded the
Yugoslavian alliance computer network system first, the smaller and weaker Yugoslavian alliance was able to confront the
NATO force squarely and several times attacked the NATO “alliance action” computer network system in an organized way
with very good results, causing the computer network on the American aircraft carrier “Roosevelt” to break down for
three hours and the British meteorological service computer network station that NATO bombing relied on to be damaged
seriously. Successful computer network warfare can make the enemy’s advanced operation concept e difficult to implement
and its weapon systems difficult to be effective, causing great weakening of the war potential and seriously affecting
the war process. Sometimes computer network warfare can even be the major factor in deciding victory or defeat in war.

Network warfare mainly includes network reconnaissance, network attack, and network defense.

# III. Psychological warfare…14

Psychological warfare is an operational action that uses all forms of information media, including all psychological
factors such as thinking, emotion, reasoning, concept, point of view, and attitude as weapons to attack the enemy,
causing the collapse of the enemy’s will and spirit, confusion in its command and decision making, wavering confidence
in operation, and decrease in combat force. Psychological warfare is divided into broad and narrow meanings. In the
broad meaning, psychological warfare is psychological struggle to reach a specific goal and it mainly includes
psychological struggle activity in politics, military, economy, culture, sport, and daily contact, so it covers a very
broad scope. In the narrow meaning, psychological warfare is an operational activity that uses human psychology on
aspects of politics, economy, and military as the operational purpose to reach a specific military goal; it influences
human psychology through various measures so it would change and develop to a predetermined direction and create a
psychological state that is beneficial to oneself and not beneficial to the enemy. The psychological warfare that we
study generally is the one with the narrow meaning and its main task is to weaken and strike the enemy, solidify and
strengthen ourselves, and reach the goal of “victory without fighting.”

Following the constantly increasing level of military information, psychological warfare’s position is heightened
constantly on the joint campaign battlefield and its effectiveness is getting more and more important. In the Iraq War,
the US military insisted on the tactics of “psychological offense being the best” and strengthened the application of
psychological warfare, making psychological warfare action “all the way.” Prior to the war, the US military gave wide
publicity, claiming it will attack Baghdad from the north and west and covering its strategic intention of swift
approach from the south, and it weakened the Iraqi main defensive military strength deployment. When the US military
attacked Baghdad, it distributed large amounts of propaganda material and letters for inducing surrender to carry out
propaganda to “overthrow Saddam” that greatly shook the Iraqi military mentality. At the end, the U.S. won the war with
less cost and in a shorter time. Through the several regional wars that have erupted recently, all nations in the world
gradually recognize that psychological warfare has the merit of decreasing war casualties and speeding up operational
process, is an important measure in information operations, and also is an indispensable important measure in joint
campaigns; therefore, they are paying more attention to the study of psychological warfare. Psychological warfare mainly
includes psychological attack and psychological defense.

# Section 3: Major Characteristics of Joint Campaign Information Operations…16

The characteristics of joint campaign information operations are the objective reflection of joint campaign information
operation patterns and essential differences from other operational activities. To accurately promulgate and have an
overall handle of the characteristics of joint campaign information operations are prerequisites to correctly carry out
joint campaign information operations direction. The major characteristics of joint campaign information operations are
as follows.

# I. It is carried out prior to the other campaign activities and also through the entire campaign process…16

During joint campaign operation activities, information operations have already become a hallmark to initiate the entire
joint campaign activity. Prior to the initiation of the joint campaign, both opposing parties put in all kinds of
information reconnaissance force to carry out multi-positional reconnaissance and detection in order to obtain the
opposition’s campaign intelligence and further judge its combat capability, troop strength deployment, and operational
plan to provide dependable basis for making the joint campaign decision and drawing up the operational plan. At the same
time, they also try their best to stop the opposition from obtaining their own information in order to cover up their
own action and intention. Most importantly is to use information attack activities such as electronic jamming, network
infiltration, and psychological attack to damage the opposition’s information system, disturb its military mentality,
and achieve the goal of interrupting its preparation to carry out the operation. The primary target in joint campaign
strike is also no longer the enemy’s heavy military groups and artillery positions, but the enemy’s information systems
such as control, command, and communication in order to create conditions for seizing and maintaining control power of
the battlefield and carrying out decisive combat. During the Gulf War, it was exactly because the US military had an
absolute information superiority that its early on campaign activity was able to achieve the result of breaking down the
Iraqi military command information system and thus laid the foundation for the smooth implementation of other
operational activities.

On the one hand, the joint campaign operation pace is fast, operational activities are various, and the battlefield
environment is complex, so the degree of its dependency on information is getting bigger and any operational activity
cannot get away from the effective support and safeguard of information operational reconnaissance, information attack,
and information defense activities. Whether in the action of seizing air dominance and sea dominance or in other
operational activities, they must have the forceful support and coordination of information operations to be able to be
carried out smoothly. On the other hand, information operations is also a type of operational activity mainly on “soft
killing” and is very hard to basically completely take away the opposition’s defensive capability, so in order to seize
control of information power, one must have the coordination of regular fire force to destroy the enemy’s information
targets. Furthermore, as a “soft killing” activity, information operations also have a nature of effectiveness in a
period of time; the seizing and maintaining of information superiority are relative and unstable and it is possible that
one can always be in control of information superiority if one unceasingly carries out information operations
surrounding the major operational activities during the entire operational process. It would determine the entire
process in the joint campaign that information operations must go through; and even after the end of the visible
battlefield confrontational activities, information operation activities are still continuously going on.

# II. Information attack and defense are closely combined and the position of information attack is prominent…17

During a joint campaign, seizing information superiority depends on carrying out information operations with highly
integrated attack and defense as the two are mutually dependent and none is dispensable. One is not able to take away
and weaken the enemy’s information control capability without information attack, cannot even talk about seizing control
of information power, and information defense will always be in passive position and eventually it will possibly lose
its meaning. At the same time, one cannot smoothly carry out information attack without information defense and one’s
own information control capability will gradually disappear. Therefore, in joint campaign information operations,
information attack and information defense must be closely combined and none can be eliminated. Being different from the
traditional operation method, information attack and information defense are not operational activities that are
mutually taking place in turn and constantly interchanging as they must always accompany each other, be connected with
each other, and cannot be separated.

Information attack is in a leading position in the struggle to seize control of information power. Information attack is
an active attack on the enemy’s information system using measures such as electromagnetic suppression, network attack,
and fire power and military strength surprise attack. Information defense mainly utilizes activities such as safe
security and protection of technology and programs to protect one’s own information system from the enemy’s jamming and
damage and it almost has no effect on the enemy’s information system; therefore, only information attack has the
function to take away and weaken the enemy’s ability to collect, transmit, and utilize information in the battlefield.
One does not have to be in an overall advantageous position to carry out information attack, as the one in the
disadvantageous position can also actively attack. The actual bodily destruction in information attack generally will
cause the defender to have difficulty to recover in rather long period of time. The party that is attacked will also
have difficulty to completely avoid seizing battlefield information superiority after suffering a sudden attack even if
it has a comparatively full information defense preparation. These characteristics of information operations indicate
that active attack and attack before the enemy does are the basic ways to seize and maintain information superiority. It
determines that information attack has a decisive function in the struggle to seize and maintain control of information
power.

# III. Information operations strength is multiple and its command and coordination are complex…18

The information operation forces that participate in a joint campaign include not only direct subordinates of the
theater but also subordinates of each operation group; not only the information operation force of the Army, Navy, and
Air Force but also the information operations force of the Second Artillery and the Armed Police units; not only the
information operations force within the organizational system but also the local nonorganizational system information
operations force participating in supporting frontline operation; and not only the specialized information operations
force with information attack activities as its major task but also the non-specialized information operations force.

Because all types of information operations activities often mutually affect and infiltrate each other, therefore, if
the command and coordination are not well organized, then, not only would it be difficult to make information operations
effective but also create serious effects on the normal operation of one’s own electronic facilities and further affect
the implementation of other operational activities; so one must comprehensively utilize the essence of these activities
and maintain their high level of coordination to eliminate conflict and internal friction that may arise in order to
achieve a mutually strengthening and mutually supporting operational result. For example, the combination of
electromagnetic attack and precise substance destruction in a large area can basically damage the enemy’s information
system; under coordination with deception electromagnetic attack, deception psychological attack can more easily deceive
the enemy’s commander; and with the assistance of thorough defense, active attack is able to achieve the goal of not
only damaging the enemy’s information control capability but also maintaining one’s own information control capability.
Therefore, it is imperative that a joint campaign commander and his command organizations should carry out planning,
coordination and control on all types of information operations forces with a macroscopic view and organize well the
concerted coordination among all military services operation group information operation activities; organize well the
coordination in information operations of major campaign directions and important campaign phases; organize well the
coordination among the specialized information operations forces; and organize well the coordination among the
electronic facility units (and branches), as well as the coordination between information operations activities and
other campaign activities.

# IV. Information operations integrates soft and hard in various measures…19

Information operations is a “dual-sided sword” that not only can carry out “soft strike” but also “hard destruction.”
The “soft strike” mainly depends on measures such as electronic jamming and computer virus attack, while “hard
destruction” mainly depends on measures such as directed energy weapons, anti-radiation weapons, and fire power attack.
In future joint campaign information operations, the gaining of battlefield superiority will, to a very large degree,
depend on an organic combination of “soft strike” and “hard destruction” information operation activities. During the
Gulf War, multinational troops led by the U.S. at the same time carried out “soft strike” information operations, mainly
electronic jamming, against Iraq and also carried out the unprecedented longest, largest-scale, strongest, and largest
category “hard destruction” information operations activity against Iraq by using directed energy weapons such as cruise
missiles and laser-guided bombs, anti-radiation weapons, and fire power strike. The US military’s information operations
activities with a combination of “soft strike” and “hard destruction” not only made the Iraqi military’s key link in
operational command and control and information systems to sink into the situation of breaking down and confusion at the
beginning, but also its powers to collect, transmit, handle, and utilize the battlefield information were taken away at
the end and its all types of operational forces were like loose sand that could only be in a passive situation and take
a beating.

Following the swift development in electronic technology, the information confrontational scope in a joint campaign
under informationized conditions has already expanded to the new domains such as command information systems, computer
networks, and space satellites and spacecraft and it not only has involved the highest command organs of the campaign
large formations but also the tactical military units and branches and has infiltrated into the command and support
systems of each military service and all types of weapon control systems. Therefore, on the information confrontational
measure, there are not only communication, radar, and command information system confrontations but also computer virus
confrontation; on the format of information confrontation, there are not only confrontations of information
reconnaissance and anti-reconnaissance but also confrontation of information attack and counterattack and information
destruction and counter-destruction. So, it has been determined that joint campaign information operations under
informationized conditions will also be a multi-measure and multi-format operation.

# V. Command information system is huge and complex and the task of information protection is large and difficult…20

The scope of a joint campaign is big with much war participating power; it has huge and complex command information
system including information detection, information transmission, and decision-making on information handling; and it
spreads over all domains in land, sea, air, and space. With the enemy laying out large numbers of remote sensing
detection equipment in space, air, sea (under water) and land, the possibility of the joint campaign command information
system’s important activities such as assembly, maneuver, and deploy not being completely discovered by the enemy does
not basically exist any longer. Facing the enemy’s high-tech weaponry such as longrange precision guided ammunition,
anti-radiation missiles, and electromagnetic pulse bombs and strike and damage of other operational activities; the
difficulty for concealing the command information system’s deployment and activities would be increased greatly.
Wireless communication is the main method for operation command and control communications and the large amount of
electromagnetic signals passing in the air would definitely be suppressed and jammed with electromagnetics in large
scale by the enemy, making accurate and timely transmission of command and control information very difficult.
Furthermore, due to the highly computerized and networking nature of the command information system, the enemy’s network
attack will cause great danger and damage to the information system, information operational process, and information
security of the joint campaign military large formations and protection of computer networks will be one of the arduous
tasks in information defense.

# VI. Battlefield electromagnetic environment is complex and affects information operational activities greatly…21

In future joint campaigns, due to large amount utilization of electronic facilities and informationized weapons and
equipment, battlefield electromagnetic radiation sources and electromagnetic signals will be highly concentrated, the
categories of radiation signals will be many, and the electromagnetic environment will be very complex. Information
operation is an operational activity carried out in the electromagnetic domain, so it will definitely be affected by the
electromagnetic environment.

The complex electromagnetic environment increases the difficulty of information reconnaissance. With the concentrated
use of a large amount of electronic facilities with highly concentrated electromagnetic signals and concentrated working
frequencies, the ability of information reconnaissance to obtain the necessary intelligence information in the extremely
crowded electromagnetic frequency spectrum will affect the ability of information receiving facilities in collecting,
selecting, recognizing, and handling signals, making it difficult for us to effectively carry out reconnaissance
positioning and friend or foe attributive recognition. In wartime, with the assistance of a strong enemy, the enemy
military carries out key point information jamming against us or frequent changing of electronic facilities working
frequency, making it difficult for us to effectively track the enemy’s various types of electromagnetic signals and
collect accurate intelligence information.

The operation of information attack measure is limited in a complex electromagnetic environment. With the increased
number and variety of electronic facilities the enemy puts in the battlefield, we must also constantly increase the
number and variety of electronic jamming facilities in order to carry out effective suppression against them. Allocation
of a large amount of electronic facilities as well as the allocation of a large amount of electronic jamming facilities
within a limited battlefield area may have serious mutual interference. Electromagnetic signal jamming under a complex
electromagnetic environment affecting normal effectiveness of one’s own electronic facilities has become a serious
problem that affects operational effectiveness. Demand for electronic jamming technology and tactical utilization has
become higher in order to lessen the effect on one’s own.

The complex electromagnetic environment increases the arduousness of the information defense task. In the operation in a
future complex electromagnetic environment, the enemy will have advanced information attack equipment and various
information attack measures that will be a rather big threat to the utilization of our information system and
informationized weapons and equipment. At the present time, the enemy’s electronic warfare equipment basically covers
the major operational frequency channels of our military wireless communications as well as warning, meteorological,
gun-directing, and fire control radars and it is a very great threat to the utilization of our main operational use
frequency equipment. In wartime, the involvement in electronic

warfare of a strong enemy will have even more measures, stronger capability, and greater influence. Faced with
increasing variety and comprehensiveness of the enemy’s information attack measures, our command information system
protection may be in a passive position of being impossible to defend effectively and being put in a double squeeze,
making the information defense task very arduous.

# Section 4: The Position and Effectiveness of Joint Campaign Information Operations…22

For a rather long period of time since the presence of information operations, people’s opinion of the position and
effectiveness of information operations in war was not unanimous. The more common view was that information operations
were an important combat support measure. Following the constant renewal in information operations equipment and the
practice of several regional wars, people are paying more attention to the position and effectiveness of information
operations in war and the traditional view has changed. Information operations is moving along the track and marching
forward from low level to high level, from partial situation to overall situation, and from an operational support
measure to operational attack and defense measures and is becoming an indispensable important measure in joint campaign
operations under informationized conditions.

# I. Information operations are an important component of joint campaign operational activities…22

In the future joint campaign battlefield, obtaining and maintaining air dominance, sea dominance, or land dominance must
have information superiority as a prerequisite. In the early stage of a joint campaign, if a war participant could not
effectively seize control of information power, then it would be very difficult to effectively expand and carry out the
other operational activities as precision ammunition would not know the target, an airplane would be discovered by the
opposition and destroyed, a ship would drift off course due to the navigational system being jammed, and the command
information system would break down due to attacks on the network. On the contrary, if a war participant could seize
battlefield information superiority, then the battlefield would become unidirectionally transparent, other types of
operational action would develop orderly, and all types of operational activities would be in a beneficial position.
During the Gulf War, multi-national troops carried out non-stop jamming on the Iraqi military command information system
one week prior to the start of the war, carried out overall communication jamming 24 hours prior to action, and carried
out large-scale, allfrequency channels blockage electronic suppression 5 hours prior to major attack. It was exactly how
the US military depended on this continuous, highly efficient, fierce, active and high power information operation
activity in the early stage to quickly take away the Iraqi military’s control power of the battlefield, and thus paved a
smooth path for the follow-up operational activities and laid a foundation for victory in the Iraq War. On the contrary,
if the multi-national troops stopped information operation activities for a period of time during the war, then the
multi-national troops might be attacked by the Iraqi hiding or remaining fire power and suffer more losses.

Therefore, one can see that information operations is one of the most important actions in a joint campaign, causes
decisive influence on the victory or defeat of war, and following the development of modern war, changes the
informationized levels of war from low gradually to high.

# II. Information operations are an effective way to seize joint campaign battlefield initiative…23

Initiative in the operation is the power of freedom and survival and the basis and prerequisite for winning operational
victory. Victory and defeat in joint campaign operations, to a large degree, are determined by the control of the
initiative in operational activities. The essence of information operations is a struggle between the opposite parties
surrounding the seizing of the control power of information. The seizing of control power of information means that one
can freely utilize information without the electromagnetic threat from the opposite party, and at the same time, take
away the power of the opposite party to freely utilize information. Information operations can effectively restrict the
effectiveness of the enemy’s weapons and guarantee one’s own large amount of weapons to effectively kill and injure the
enemy’s troops; it can clarify the enemy’s deployment, fire power system, operational intent, and major direction to
benefit one’s own to purposefully organize joint campaign activities; it can cover up one’s own deployment, operational
intent, and fire power organization to avoid being damaged by the enemy’s fire power; and it can break down the enemy’s
command, communication, and control systems so the enemy information cannot be transmitted, its operation troops have no
command, and it cannot form an organized “fist.” In joint campaign operations under future conditions, the party that is
in control of information power will have great possibility to be in control of air dominance and sea dominance, further
seize the war initiative, and strongly be in control of the war development situation to create the necessary condition
for seizing war victory. The party that loses control of information power will sink into a passive condition of
discontinued wireless communications, blinded radars, guided weapons losing control, optoelectronic facilities not
functioning, and confused command and coordination and eventually lost control of the battlefield, leading to failure in
war. One can see that seizing control of information power will win the initiative for joint campaign operational
activities, guarantee the military operational; activities’ power of freedom and survival, and lay a foundation and
create a prerequisite condition for winning joint campaign operation victory. When one loses control of information
power, one also loses the power of freedom and survival in operations and cannot do anything at all in seizing
operational victory.

# III. Information operations have become an indispensable operational measure in joint campaign operations…24

Following the development of modern information technology, information operations have broken through the traditional
domains of wireless communications and radar confrontation and optoelectronic and acoustic confrontation and expanded to
such aspects as network confrontation and psychological confrontation, developed from single measure confrontation to
multi-measure comprehensive confrontation and from pure operation support measure to more direct attack and defense
operation measure. Electronic warfare measures can be used to confront troops equipped with electronic information
facilities (systems); network warfare measures can damage the enemy’s network information system in the battlefield;
electromagnetic pulse weapons can damage all kinds of electronic equipment and systems; psychological warfare measures
can carry out psychological attack against the enemy; and successful utilization of antiradiation missile, -laser,
-particle beam and –high power microwave weapons will provide information operations with a hard killing capability to
destroy all types of electronic facilities and systems. At the same time that information operations fiercely threaten
and strike the enemy, it also bears the responsibility of preventing one’s own information system and facilities from
the enemy’s information operations threat and strike. This peculiar attack and defense operational capability has made
information operations to rise from an operation support measure in earlier campaigns to an indispensable important
attack and defense operation measure with soft and hard killing capability in joint campaigns.

# IV. Information operations capability has become an important mark of joint campaign operational capability…25

All sorts of weapons including artillery, tanks, airplanes, warships, and missiles utilized by modern military are
equipped in different degree with electronic information facilities and command information system that commands modern
military operations cannot even get away from electronic facilities. It is exactly because electronic facilities plays
such an important role in a modern military that the level of information operations capability of a troop has a great
effect on the winning and losing of joint operations. The regional wars since the 90s of the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$
century have made people deeply understand that a strong information operations capability is a prerequisite for winning
modern war victory and information operations capability has become an important mark to measure the level of modern
military joint campaign operation capability.

All nations in the world pay much attention to information operations and they spend a large amount of money for
military expense, try their best to maintain quantitative and qualitative superiority in information operations
equipment, and constantly improve their information operations organizational mechanism to strengthen information
operations capability build-up. Information operations capability has become an important portion in various factors of
foreign military combat force. Taking the US military as an example, after the 80s of the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$
century, its research budget on information operations has been increasing greatly every year. In 1985, the total expense the U.S. spent on information
operations was $\$ 56$ hundred millions and after the 90s of the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century, its yearly actual
expense on information technology and equipment could reach $\$ 400-500$ hundred millions. The key point of US military
current and future investment on information technology also concentrates on increasing command information system
capability and precision attack capability. The Japanese military proposed to put information warfare capability along
with fire power and maneuvering power as the third striking force. In recent years, the Chinese Military Commission
headquarters has paid high attention to the build-up of information operations power and considers information
operations power one of the Chinese military six major strategic forces.

# Section 5: The Meaning in Joint Campaign Information Operations Study…26

Following the swift development of information technology, information operations position and effectiveness in joint
campaigns have become more profound and the information operations issue is the key, difficult, and hot point issue in
the leading edge of military theory study of all major militarily strong nations in the world currently. The study of
joint campaign information operations has important meaning in further development and improvement of joint campaign
information operations theory and for providing a basis for even more systematic and functioning to the joint campaign
commanders and their command organization to organize and carry out information operations.

# I. The requirements of joint campaign information operational implementation and development…26

After entering into the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century, all-military campaign information operations training and
exercise activities are getting more popular; however, the retardation in theoretical instruction will definitely affect
the increase in exercise results and standards and the implementation of joint campaign information operations has
constantly asked for the earliest present of a joint campaign information operation theoretical system. The units (and
branches) that are responsible for information attack tasks are in urgent need of campaign information operations attack
theory to guide and regulate their activities in order to meet the requirements of information operations training;
those that are responsible for information defense task are waiting for systematic and practical information defense
theory to guide their actual activity in order to confront future information attack threats; joint campaign commanders
and their command organizations are asking for the functional joint campaign information operations methods and
principles for them to use; and all colleges and universities are urgently hoping to establish a joint campaign
information operations theoretical system to meet the need for instruction and research in order to benefit the
formation and development of information operation academic system. Doubtlessly, as long as there is requirement to
practice joint campaign information operation, a theoretical system should be established and developed.

# II. The important measures to speed up pushing for military struggle preparation…27

Facing the information age war challenge in the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century, we must study and understand the
information operations thinking of the potential enemy’s military strategy and analyze and clarify the electromagnetic
environment in the surrounding of the future possible battlefield to greatly push for our military leap-over development
and quicken well preparation for military struggle in order for our military operational activities to meet reality in
the future battlefield.

The opposition in future war is an enemy with strong support and possessing obvious information superiority, and if we
let it develop further its information superiority, then it would be impossible for our military to have “decisive
victory in war.” Therefore, we must target the peculiarity of military struggle preparation, deepen the study of joint
campaign information operations issues, and understand very clearly the guiding ideas, basic principles, operation
tasks, activity types, basic methods of operation, major measures, and countermeasures of our military joint campaign
information operations in the future. The study and establishment of corresponding joint campaign information operations
theory are beneficial to all military officers and men to further unify ideological understanding and establish the
concept of using information to win; and they are also beneficial in guiding and towing the preparation and build-up of
our military information operations and in seizing victory in future joint campaign information operations.

# III. The urgent need to establish a joint campaign information operations theory with our military special characteristics…27

Currently, all major nations’ military in the world place the basic point of military theoretical transformation on the
study of informationized war operation theory. Such new concepts, new viewpoints, and new doctrine as “informationized
warfare,” “information warfare,” “information operations,” “command and control warfare,” and “computer network warfare”
are emerging in an endless stream and information operations theory has become a “commanding point” of campaign
operations theory. One must raise the study of information operation theory to the position of strategy study in order
to win future regional wars under informationized conditions.

However, because our military study of information operations is still in the transitional period from elementary study
stage to high level study stage, there are still some issues that cannot be ignored, such as copying the information
operations theory of foreign militaries, leaning more to study of information operations technical measures, and
inadequate study of the harmonious nature of the combination between campaign and tactics. Therefore, we must target the
existing shortage and problems in information operations theory study, use joint campaigns as the background, and seize
and maintain control of information power in the battlefield as the goal to overall and systematically analyze and
elaborate some key and difficult issues of future joint campaign information operations and then provide methods and
measures to adhere to and as basis in carrying out information operations training and activities to the joint campaign
commanders and their command organizations and establish a joint campaign information operations theoretical system with
our military special characteristics.

# IV. Inner requirements to regulate joint campaign information operations training order…28

Our military joint campaign information operations theoretical study started considerably later; it was not until
January 1999 that Guidelines for Chinese People’s Liberation Army Joint Campaigns was issued to officially include
information operation in the content of joint campaign operations. Through constant exploration in recent years, the
understanding of information operations basic theory has gradually become unified and preliminarily formed an
information operations theoretical system; however, the deficiency is that the transformation from information
operations theory to training theory remains rather lagging behind. At present time, the gap in the study of all
military information operations training theory is quite large and the troop information operations training has nothing
to follow, does not know where to start, and cannot organize itself that it seriously restricts the enhancement of our
military information operation capability. Strengthening the study of joint campaign information operation training and
constantly raising the joint campaign information operations capability have become an urgent task in front of all
military services.

Strengthening the study of joint campaign information operations theory is exactly in meeting the requirement of all
military services’ joint campaign information operations training and it not only is beneficial to regulating the joint
campaign information operations training procedure, but also is beneficial to speeding up information operation
capability build-up. It not only is able to fulfill the knowledgeseeking psychology in all levels unit and get rid of
the blindness in joint campaign information operations training, but also to forcefully direct the troop’s information
operations training, push the enhancement of the overall information operations attainment, and promote the increase in
quality of all sorts of information operations preparation and enhancement of the overall information operation
capability.

# V. Gradually integrate the requirements to understand joint campaign information operations ideology…29

Even though, as of now, our military has never carried out a joint campaign information operations in modern term, but
the constant development in information technology and increase of social informationized levels have brought an
understanding of information operations. Through several years of study, the whole military’s understanding of
information operations has been constantly deepening and they have a certain understanding of the concept and substance,
responsibility and demand, and major actions of information operations, but their viewpoint is not entirely unanimous.
Being a component of joint campaign operations theory, we must have a standardized understanding of some major issues of the joint campaign information operations in order to form a unified will and to
coordinate in unity to gain success in information operations.

Strengthening the study of joint campaign information operations theory can put together the information operations
issues scattered in such domains as campaign, command, communication, and electronic countermeasure into one system and
carry out a comprehensive study. It can reveal the common patterns of joint campaign information operations and provide
method and strategy for utilizing these patterns to direct joint campaign information operations. It can grasp the
essence of joint campaign information operations and have a handle of the substance of joint campaign information
operations in order to create favorable conditions for achieving joint campaign initiative by unifying the ideological
understanding of the commanders of war participating units in such aspects as guiding ideology, basic principles,
responsibility and demand, and methods of operation, and measure and standardize activities according to a unified
theoretical guidance to achieve concerted activities and integrated coordination, and formulate joint forces of all
bodies to seize information superiority.

# Chapter 2 Development History of Joint Campaign Information Operations…30

The emergence and development of information operations (IO) are the inevitable product of the wide-ranging application
of information technology (IT) {xinxi zuozhan} in the military field $\{ lin gyu \}$ . They are both the result of the
pull of military needs $\{ xuq i u \}$ and the further propelling of technology, and also the result of the deepening of
people’s understanding of war activity laws {zhanzheng huodong guilyu} from [the viewpoint of] the relationship of
science and technology (S&T) to war. Within past wars, although they did not put forth the IO of today, nonetheless an
information trial of strength actually was present simultaneously with war, and developed to accompany the development
of war. In studying [researching] {yanjiu} IO, one should understand the origins, formation, development, and motive
factors {dongyin} in the development of IO.

# Section 1: The Origins of Joint Campaign IO…30

With regard to the exploitation of information, it was already known in ancient times; but IO truly used at the campaign
level {zhanyi cengci} is an event which occurred after the invention of modern communication means {tongxin shouduan}.
It is generally held that joint campaign IO originated in the period from the late $1 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century
up to the beginning of the Second World War.

In the mid-to-late $1 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century, the invention of the wired telegraph, telephone, and radio
telegraph and their application on the battlefield enabled the realization of beyond-visual-range [BVR] {chaoshiji}
long-distance real-time communication {yuanjuli shishi tongxin $\}$ , and realized [end of page 30] long-distance
communication from warship {junjian} to warship, and from warship to land. People began to apply radio receivers to
eavesdrop {qieting} on the enemy’s wireless communication in order to acquire intelligence, and used radio transmitters
{fasheji} to conduct jamming {ganrao} and sabotage {pohuai} of enemy communications. In particular, the wideranging
application of Morse code $\{ m o ^ { \prime } ers idi anm a \}$ in the military made transmitting {chuandi} information
among the armed forces even more convenient, speedier $\{ kua iji e \}$ , and higher in efficiency $\{ gao xia o \}$ ,
so that even if two armed forces were separated by a hundred or even a thousand kilometers (km), they could still
without the least effort {毫无费力地 haowu feilidi} communicate with one another, understand one another, and
adjust-coordinate with one another $\{ hux ian gxi eti a o \}$ . The invention of the telegraph and telephone extended
man’s auditory organs, and created “clairaudience” $\{ \ { } ^ { } shu nfe n g ^ { , } e r ^ { , , } \}$ , so that
people were able to hear large amounts of information beyond their instinctive hearing; and the invention of the
telescope and radar extended man’s visual organs, and created “clairvoyance” {“qianliyan”}, so that people were able to
acquire large amounts of information beyond their instinctive vision. Thus, IO within modern war, besides being carried
out within humankind’s natural instinctive information acquisition versus counter-acquisition, also exploits technical
means and thus has unfolded {zhankai} information warfare [IW] {xinxi duikang}. In other words, IO, on the basis of
intelligence warfare {qingbaozhan} and psychological warfare [PSYWAR] {xinlizhan}, also has opened up a new operational field – electronic warfare [EW] {dianzizhan}.

In the Russo-Japanese War which broke out in 1904, the Russian military began to conduct electronic reconnaissance
{dianzi zhencha} and electronic jamming {dianzi ganrao} against the Japanese military, and [thus] caused a setback to
the Japanese warships’ offensive {jingong}. This was the world’s first implementation of EW {dianzi duikang} against an
enemy; and even though {jinguan} it was something unconscious or a clouding of consciousness {yishi mohu}, it
nonetheless drew open the curtain on modern campaign IO. In February 1904, Japan and Russia, to contend for dominance
{zhengduo… kongzhiquan} over China’s Northeast and the Korean Peninsula, initiated the world-shocking Russo-Japanese
War. Within this war, the engaging sides {jiaozhan shuangfang} for the first time within operations employed radio to
carry out signal communications {tongxin lianluo}. In the early period of the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese military
was preemptive $\{ xia nfa zhi ren \}$ , and took the initiative $\{ zhu don g \}$ ; but for a long time it was unable
to capture Lushun seaport [Port Arthur]. The reason was that the Russian military’s radio operators discovered that
increases in the Japanese military’s radio signals were portents of their attacks. Hence, the Russian military – via
this important information on “increases in the Japanese military radio signals” – timely and accurately predicted
{zhunque yubao} the Japanese military’s attacks. This then was the emergence of electronic reconnaissance – the world’s
earliest exploitation of electromagnetic [EM] signals {dianci xinhao} to in advance issue warnings {jingbao} of an
enemy’s raids $\{ xij i \}$ . In March 1904, the Japanese Navy concentrated {jizhong} [end of page 31] firepower
bombardments {paoji} of the Russian warships moored in the channels within Lushun harbor. Since the Japanese warships
from overseas could not see the Russian warships moored within the harbor, their commander {zhihuiguan} decided to use
one small destroyer $\{ xia oxi ngq uzh uji a n \}$ , moored at a certain advantageous location near the seacoast, to
serve as an artillery observation post {paobing guanchashao}, to observe the impact points {danzhuodian} of the
artillery shells {paodan} fired by the Japanese ships, and to use radio to carry out correction {jiaozheng} of the
firing. At first, the Japanese naval gun {jianpao} [shells], just as if they had grown eyes, accurately flew toward
their targets. However, a Russian radio operator within the Lushun seaport base {jidi} heard in his headset the
communication signals between the Japanese ships. He had a bright idea {灵机一动 lingji yidong}, and pressed down on his
telegraph transmitter {fabaoji} key, thinking in this manner to impede the communications among the Japanese ships. Sure
enough, the Japanese military’s wireless telegraphers suddenly heard very great static $\{ zay i n \}$ between the
transceivers $\{ dia nta i \}$ , and new firing target {sheji mubiao} information basically could not be transmitted, so
that the Japanese military’s artillery shells no longer could effectively hit their targets. This can be said to be the
first radio communication jamming in the history of war. As of this point, the two basic essential factors $\{ \nu aos u
\}$ of EW – electronic reconnaissance and electronic jamming – had been declared to the world, and EW had formally
mounted the stage of war. During the following Russo-Japanese naval battle of Tsushima {对马海战 duima haizhan}, Japan’s
Combined Fleet {lianhe jiandui} employed electronic reconnaissance means to monitor {jianting} the Russian fleet’s radio/wireless communication $\{ wux ian dia nto ngx i n \}$ , and grasped the movements {dongxiang} of the Russian
fleet. In a predetermined sea zone {yuding haiyu} it set up an ambush attack $\{ she fug ong j i \}$ , and via radio
jamming facilities equipment {ganrao shebei}, it disturbed the Russian ships’ signal communications, and achieved a
major victory in which it sank 19 warships and captured 7 warships of the Russian fleet. These were the world’s first IW
activities {xinxi duikang xingdong} conducted by initiativebased application $\{ zhu don gyu nyo n g \}$ of modern IT,
and also marked the formal emergence of EW.

During the First World War, IO with EW as the main content had its initial application within campaign operations. At
that time, radio/wireless communication technology saw fairly universal application in the armed forces of the various
nations, and in operational command $\{ zuo zha nzh ihu i \}$ it brought into play ever more important roles {zuoyong}.
Radio direction finders {wuxiandian cexiangji} entered real combat $\left\{ shi zha n \right\}$ , electronic jamming
began to be consciously applied in operations, and several of the main military powers began to organize and build EW
units {dianzizhan budui}. In 1914, the British and French navies, with superior force-strength {youshi bingli} in the
Mediterranean Sea, jointly carried out stalking $\{ wei b u \}$ of Germany’s fleet, and tried to annihilate {jianmie}
it. Britain’s cruiser {xunyangjian} Gloucester {“格林斯特” 号 “gelinsite” hao} [end of page 32] undertook $\{ dan fia \}$ the
mission of tailing the German warships; its goals $\{ mud i \}$ were to timely acquire the tracks $\{ xin gzo n g \}$ of
the German ships, and to use radio/wireless communication to timely report the activity situation of the German ships to
the Royal Navy General Headquarters $[ \mathrm { H Q } ] \ \{ zon gbu \}$ , so as to organize force-strengths for
carrying out surrounding and annihilation {围歼 weijian}. However, the British ships’ signal communications were
intercepted {zhenting} by the German ships, and their high-level radio/wireless communication also suffered intense
electronic jamming by the German ships. Although the British several times changed their transmitting frequency, their
communication always was jammed by a samefrequency-band {tongyi pinduan} signal sent out by the German ships, and they
thus could not organize force-strengths to carry out surrounding and annihilation. The German ships seized this
favorable opportunity for combat {zhanji}; suddenly turned about in navigation route $\{ han gxi a n \}$ ; successfully
shed the British fleet’s encirclement, pursuit, obstruction, and interception {weizhui dujie}; and barely escaped from
the jaws of death {虎口逃生 hukou taosheng}.

In August 1914, tsarist Russia’s 650,000-man army $\{ daj u n \}$ , divided into the $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ and $2 ^
{ \mathrm { n d } }$ Group Armies {jituanjun}, mounted a large-scale offensive {daju jingong} against Germany. In the
northeastern part of the battle lines, Germany only had the $8 ^ { \mathrm { { t h } } }$ Group Army to resist the
Russian military’s offensive, so the circumstances {形势 xingshi} were extremely unfavorable to the German military. Just
at that time, the Russian military, which lacked elementary knowledge of the new electronic technology $\{ dia nzi jis h
u \}$ , used plain code {mingma} to send out a copy of a top-secret telegram {juemi dianbao} on the force-strength
disposition $\{ bin gli bus h u \}$ and operational plans {zuozhan jihua}, and this important telegram to its surprise
was intercepted {qieting} by a German military radio station {wuxiandian tai}. The German military, via analysis and
study $\{ fen xiy anj i u \}$ of the telegram’s content, discovered that there was a gap more than $1 0 0 \mathrm { k m
}$ wide between the Russian military’s two group armies, and that the complementation $\{ pei h e \}$ between these two
group armies of the Russian military was very poor. Hence, the German military first concentrated its main force and
launched a fierce offensive against the Russian military’s $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Group Army; and when it learned
that the Russian military’s $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ Group Army had no intention of carrying out reinforcement $\{ zen
gyu a n \}$ of the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ Group Army, the German military then felt relieved and boldly used a
force-strength of only one division to contain {qianzhi} the 24 divisions of the Russian military’s $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t
} }$ Group Army, and thus used most portions of its force-strengths to surround and annihilate the $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d
} }$ Group Army. As a result, the German military very rapidly annihilated the Russian military’s $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d }
}$ Group Army, and afterward in turn concentrated its force-strengths and annihilated the Russian military’s $1 ^ {
\mathrm { s t } }$ Group Army. In this campaign, the German military, by only paying the price of 10,000 casualties
{shangwang}, thus killed, wounded, and captured almost 300,000 men of the Russian military. Although the means of EW
during the First World War were extremely simple, and although the quantity used, scale, and goals which needed to be
achieved all were very limited, nonetheless the enormous might $\{ wei l i \}$ which EW displayed shocked people, and
impelled several nations’ militaries to begin developing {yanzhi} specialized {zhuanmen} [end of page 33] EW equipment
{dianzizhan zhuangbei}, and to organize and build professional EW units {zhuanyede dianzizhan budui}.

Although EW {dianzi duikang} commenced during the First World War, nonetheless the technology still was not mature, its
application within campaigns similarly was not widespread, the confrontational means {duikang shouduan} were unitary,
and the modes {fangshi} were relatively simple. Interception $\{ zhe nti n g \}$ and direction finding {cexiang} were
taken as primary, with occasional use of electronic jamming; these lacked professional facilities equipment for EW, and
were limited to being within the scope of communications countermeasures [CCM] {tongxin duikang}, so that the effects
were limited. Thus, EW still had not attracted universal attention. Moreover, just in terms of the joint campaign
itself, this phase similarly was still not fully mature, and IO even more had not become an important component {zucheng
bufen} of the joint campaign.

# Section 2: The Formation of Joint Campaign IO…34

The formative period of joint campaign IO mainly signifies the period from the Second World War up to just before the
Persian Gulf War {haiwan zhanzheng}. IW technology {xinxizhan jishu} saw development, special-purpose IW facilities
equipment {xinxi duikang shebei} was fielded to the units, a small number of IO units were created, and IO started to
become an important component of joint operations. The formative period of joint campaign IO can be divided into two
phases: the World War II era and the postwar period up to the Persian Gulf War.

# I. Joint campaign IO in the World War II era…34

During World War II, due to war needs and requirements $\{ xuy a o \}$ , the opposing sides {didui shuangfang} put great
energy into research and development [R&D] {yanfa} of navigation {daohang} and radar technologies, and unfolded
{zhankai} sharp EW centering on their application. Radar countermeasures [RCM] {leida duikang}, CCM, electro-optical
[E-O] countermeasures $\{ gua ngd ian dui kan g \}$ , and hydroacoustic countermeasures {shuisheng duikang} together
constituted the basic content of EW, and established the position $\{ diw e i \}$ of EW within war. Nations one after
another launched {kaizhan} research into EW technology, and constantly created special-purpose EW equipment to throw
into real combat. Use of radio and radar enabled the operational activities {zuozhan xingdong} in the air and on the
ground (at sea) to be adjustedcoordinated consistently. Air dominance/supremacy {zhikongquan} became an important
assurance of land dominance {zhiluquan} and sea dominance {zhihaiquan}, [end of page 34] and there emerged new
operational patterns {zuozhan yangshi} such as EW.

By 1935 and 1936, Britain, the U.S., and Germany had produced {shengchan} radar systems {leida xitong}. In 1935, Britain
[first] produced air defense radar {fangkong leida} which could detect aircraft, and this precipitated the debut of
radar jamming instrument equipment {leida ganrao qicai}. In 1940, the Wehrmacht [German military], in order to bomb
Britain, built a series of “Lorenz” {“洛仑兹” “luolunzi”} navigation systems in northern France. The British military, in
order to jam the Lorenz systems, developed the “Meacon” {“米康” “mikang”} analog jamming system {moni ganrao xitong}. The
Wehrmacht also successively developed the “LFF” {“拉芬” “lafen”} [Landefunkfeuer] and “Benito” {“贝尼托” “beinituo”}
navigation systems, and the British military also developed the “Bromide” {“布罗米德” “buluomide”}, “Domino” {“多米诺”
“duominuo”}, and other special-purpose navigation jamming instrument equipment and their countermeasures. In 1940-1941,
the British military built special-purpose radar electronic jamming systems such as “Aspirin” {“阿斯匹林” “asipilin”} and
“Bromide” {“澳化剂” “aohuaji”}, conducted jamming against the Wehrmacht’s radar, and [thus] caused the Wehrmacht’s air
defense system of systems [SoS] {fangkong tixi} to further fall into a passive situation {beidong jumian}. At the same
time, the British military developed passive jamming $\{ wuy uan gan rao \}$ instrument equipment – [metal] chaff
{jinshu botiao} – and when the Anglo-American joint forces {lianjun} conducted large-scale air raids on Hamburg,
Germany, they for the first time employed passive jamming chaff, totaling 2.5 million cassettes. This caused the
Wehrmacht to falsely count the 790 British and American bombers {hongzhaji} participating in the air raids as several
thousand such planes.

During the war, following on the needs and requirements of air combat $\{ kon gzh a n \}$ and sea combat {haizhan}, RCM
were formed and saw rapid development. From the viewpoint of CCM aspects, ground jamming facilities equipment
experienced fairly great development, and dozens of types of specialized CCM facilities equipment emerged. At the same
time, airborne communication jammers {jizaide tongxin ganraoji} also emerged. As for the RCM aspects, besides active
jamming $\{ you yua nga nra o \} .$ , passive jamming instrument equipment such as chaff and angular reflectors
{jiaofansheqi} was widely applied on the battlefield, and specialized aircraft for conducting jamming against radar
appeared; camouflage and deception {weizhuang, qipian} were widely applied within campaign and combat activity {zhandou
xingdong}, and became important support measures within campaigns and battles.6

During the Normandy landing campaign $\{ den glu zha nyi \}$ , the synthetic [comprehensive] application $\{ zon ghe yun
yon g \}$ of many types of instrument equipment and multiple means within EW activities brought into play extremely
important roles in terms of achieving the surprise quality {turanxing} in the campaign and seizing the battlefield
initiative {zhudongquan}. The “[Operation] Fortitude, North” {“北方坚韧” “beifang jianren”} deception plan which the
US-British allied forces {mengjun} implemented in northern Europe contained a Wehrmacht force-strength of 10-some
divisions, so that it did not dare to transfer them to France [end of page 35] to participate in anti-landing $\{ kan
gde ngl u \}$ operations. The “[Operation] Quicksilver” $\{ \ ^ { \ast } shu iyi n ^ { \prime \prime } \}$ deception
plan implemented at Dover created in the Wehrmacht the false impression that the allied forces were about to conduct a
large-scale landing in the Calais area $\{ diq u \}$ , and caused the Wehrmacht to produce a mistaken assessment of the
allied forces’ main landing direction {zhuyao denglu fangxiang}. At the same time, the allied forces synthetically
applied multiple EW measures to conduct jamming and deception against the Wehrmacht, and successfully provided important
support for the landing. Within the operation, accompanying the main attack formations $\{ zhu gon gbi and u i \}$ ,
they conducted active jamming {jiji ganrao} of the Wehrmacht’s radar and communication in the Normandy direction, and
shortened its reconnaissance distance {zhencha juli} and detection probability $\{ fax ian gai lyu \}$ in the main
landing direction. At the same time, in the Calais area, the allied forces used aircraft for large-quantity release of
jamming chaff $\{ gan rao \ bot iao \}$ and mounted angular reflectors on motor launches $\{ qit ing \}$ ; this jammed
and deceived the Wehrmacht’s radar, and created the false impression that an allied forces large-scale fleet was
launching an offensive. These measures successfully deceived the Wehrmacht, and created extremely favorable conditions
for achieving success in the landing campaign.

# II. Joint campaign IO from the end of World War II up to the Persian Gulf War…36

Since the end of World War II, although no more world wars have occurred, nonetheless no fewer than 100-some local wars
and armed conflicts {wuzhuang chongtu} of various natures, scale, and patterns have occurred. All of these local wars to
different degrees have reflected several characteristics {tedian} of modern war, and even have revealed the embryonic
form {雏形 chuxing} of future informationized wars {xinxihua zhanzheng}. Among these local wars and conflicts, those
having a fairly great influence are the Korean War {chaoxian zhanzheng}, the Vietnam War, the [four] Mideast Wars, the
Falklands War {马岛战争 madao zhanzheng}, and the War in Lebanon. Within these wars, the position and role {diwei zuoyong}
of IO have been prominent, and its scope and influence have been extremely wide-ranging; this has attracted maximum
attention from the armed forces of nations around the world. IO theory has begun to become an attention point for
research, and the application of computers in the military has greatly boosted the capability for IO. Large quantities
of informationized equipment {xinxihua zhuangbei} are being developed {yanzhi} for application in the armed forces, and
IO is starting to consciously become a relatively independent phase to be implemented within military activities.

Beginning in the 1960s, communication, radar, and E-O technologies saw fullspeed development, and the large-quantity
application of guided weapons {zhidao wuqi} simultaneously became the main means of attack. This impelled the all-around
development of IO technology; various types of special-purpose EW aircraft, [end of page 36] electronic reconnaissance
satellites {dianzi zhencha weixing}, expendable jamming facilities equipment {touzhishi ganrao shebei}, anti-radiation
missiles [ARMs] {fanfushe daodan}, and similar EW weaponry {dianzi duikang bingqi} were successively thrown into
operations, and brought into play a clear combat power “multiplier” {zhandouli “beizengqi”} role within modern
operations. During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam for the first time within anti-air raid operations {fankongxi zuozhan}
adopted brand-new air defense missile [ADM] weaponry {fangkong daodan bingqi}; this altered the past operational model
$\{ zuo zha n ~ mos h i \}$ in which aircraft were first and antiaircraft guns $\{ gao pao \}$ were second within
struggle {douzheng} against air-raiding aircraft, so that ADMs became the basic strengths {liliang} for defense $\{ fan
gyu \}$ . The hit probability {mingzhonglyu} of this type of radar-guided ADM generally could reach $9 5 \%$ . However,
after the US military employed airborne radar warning {jizai leida gaojing} and electronic jamming, the hit probability
then markedly decreased, to $1 . 4 \% - 2 \%$ . The 1973 Fourth Mideast War [or “Yom Kippur War”] even more involved an
electronic battlefield for repeated trials of strength between the EW strengths of the engaging sides. Since the
Egyptians had fielded “SAM- $\cdot 6 ^ { \circ }$ {“samu-6”} missiles guided by new-frequency-band gun aiming radar
{paomiao leida} and continuous wave [CW] radar {lianxubo leida}, and “SAM-7” infrared [IR] guided missiles {hongwai
zhidaode daodan} equipped with IRjam-resistant filter lenses {kanghongwai ganrao lyubojing}, the Israeli military did
not have a clear understanding of timely reconnaissance and [thus] did not adopt the corresponding resistance measures,
so that at the beginning of open hostilities {开战伊始 kaizhan yishi} it suffered huge losses.

Beginning in the 1970s, following on the large-quantity application of IT in the military field, advanced weapons and
equipment {wuqi zhuangbei} within the armed forces were already informationized. There appeared large quantities of
high-tech operational platforms, precision-guided munitions [PGMs] {jingque zhidao danyao}, EW weapons {dianzizhan
wuqi}, night vision instrument equipment {yeshi qicai}, and fulldimensional {quanfangwei}, full-time-domain $\{ qua nsh
iyu \}$ , all-weather reconnaissance, surveillance {jianshi}, detection $\{ tan c e \}$ , navigation, and positioning
systems {dingwei xitong}. In particular, the use of command information systems {zhihui xinxi xitong} fused
on-battlefield intelligence reconnaissance $\{ qin gba ozh enc h a \}$ , communication, command, control, and strike
into an organic whole $\{ yit i \}$ , so that the position of information within war had a qualitative leap. Information
became the “leading factor {zhudao yinsu} in victory or defeat in war,” and enabled the emergence of joint campaign IO
to become possible. In particular, CCM systems and integrated RCM systems {zonghe leida duikang xitong} have been formed
as triads $\{ san wei yit i \}$ composed of EW reconnaissance, survey [measurement] $\{ cel ian g \}$ , and jamming
facilities equipment. The prominent role they brought into play within war and the enormous influence they produced
played extremely important driving roles in the all-around development of EW. In the Bekaa Valley battle between Israel
and Syria in 1982, to understand how Israel [end of page 37] only took 6 minutes to destroy in a stroke 19 of Syria’s
SAM-6 missiles, and how in air combat it shot down 79 Soviet-made MiG aircraft of Syria’s at a minuscule price, the main
reason is that prior to combat, Israel – by stealing and releasing into air unpiloted electronic decoy aircraft {wuren
jiashide dianzi youer feiji} – ascertained the tactical technical parameters {zhanshu jishu canshu} of the Syrian
military’s ADM radar, and in a manner having a directed [focused] quality {you zhenduixing di}, as a result implemented
electronic jamming against that radar.

# Section 3: The Development of Joint Campaign IO…38

This period mainly signifies that from the Persian Gulf War to the present, joint campaign IO from theory to practice
has seen major developments. In particular, during the Gulf War and Kosovo War, it acquired all-around demonstration,
its important position and role won universal acknowledgement {举世公认 jushi gongren}, and IO capability became an
important standard {biaozhun} for judging the combat power of a nation’s armed forces.

During the 1991 Gulf War, the electronic struggle – with electronic reconnaissance versus counter-reconnaissance
{fanzhencha}, jamming versus counterjamming {fanganrao}, destruction versus counter-destruction {fancuihui}, and control
versus counter-control {fankongzhi} as its main content—was unusually sharp and complex, and became within war the
content of a trial of strength with material destruction $\{ wuz h i ~ cui hui \}$ and counter-destruction having the
same level of importance. As far back as the period before the start of the war, the US military had dispositioned $\{
bus h u \}$ 10-some photographic and electronic reconnaissance satellites in the space over the Persian Gulf, and
conducted full-dimensional, uninterrupted {bujianduan} rigorous surveillance {yanmi jianshi} of Iraq. Also, the
Coalition Forces {duoguo budui} had in three directions—Israel, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia {沙特 shate} – dispositioned a
group of airborne electronic reconnaissance jamming aircraft {kongzhong dianzi zhencha ganrao feiji}, including the
EA-6B, EF-111A, EC-130, and F-4G, which had electronic and IR jamming facilities equipment and omnidirectional warning
systems {quanxiang gaojing xitong}, as well as 8 EW intelligence battalions {dianzizhan qingbao ying} and 5-7 EW
intelligence companies {dianzizhan qingbao lian} equipped with radar transmitting positioning and reconnaissance systems
{leida fashe dingwei zhencha xitong}, radar reconnaissance receiving systems, communication intercept and
directionfinding systems {tongxin zhenshou cexiang xitong}, and communication jamming systems. [Coalition Forces thus]
completely seized EM dominance {zhidianciquan} in the theater space {zhanqu kongjian}. [end of page 38] After the start
of Operation “Desert Storm” {“shamo fengbao” xingdong}, the US military conducted an electronic offensive, code named
Operation “White Snow” {“baixue” xingdong}, in EM space. This involved large-area, long-lasting jamming of the Iraqi
military’s communication systems, and led to the Iraqi side’s command and control [C2] systems {zhihui kongzhi xitong}
being completely paralyzed {tanhuan}, its radar screens being covered with snowflakes, and its radio stations {guangbo
diantai} for a while being out of order {失常 shichang}. Within the air raid process, the Coalition Forces used AGM-88A
anti-radar missiles to accurately strike at the Iraqi side’s air defense systems: as long as an Iraqi radar was turned
on, within a few seconds the anti-radar missiles were able to accurately destroy it. These powerful attacks in the
battlefield information field, with EW as the main form {形式 xingshi}, ensured that the Coalition Forces all along seized
the battlefield initiative. During the Gulf War, the degree of ferocity in the Coalition Forces’ electronic attacks and
the enormous role brought into play by them were things never experienced within past wars.

The Kosovo War pushed IO toward a new development phase. During the Kosovo War, the US military, besides applying
traditional EW means, also widely employed a good many new-concept weapons {xin gainian wuqi} to execute crushing
strikes {huimiexing daji} on the information systems and electric power systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
[FRY] {南联盟 nan lian meng}. For example, it repeatedly used conventional EM pulse bombs [E-bombs] {dianci maichong dan},
leading to “large-area paralysis” of the FRY’s electronic information systems. The US military also for the first time
used carbon-fiber graphite bombs {tan xianwei shimo zhadan} to specially strike at and sabotage the FRY’s electric power
systems. After this type of bomb exploded in the air, it could produce large quantities of long thin carbonfiber strips;
once these strips fell onto high-voltage transmission lines or transformers, they could create short-circuits, and thus
incinerate the power transmission equipment and paralyze the electric power system. It is thus clear that new-concept
weapons became a new means of EW.

In [the history of] human war, the Kosovo War was the first large-scale war reported over the Internet {hulianwang}. As
soon as the war began, NATO exploited the Internet, and repeatedly at great length {连篇累牍 lianpian leidu} reported the
so-called true state of the war $\{ zha nzh eng zhe nxi ang \}$ , to prepare the public {鸣锣开道 mingluo kaidao} for the
war’s actions $\{ xin gji n g \}$ . Simultaneously with this, the FRY, in order to counterattack {fanji} NATO’s
propaganda warfare, also exploited Internet sites {zhandian} to constantly transmit its own voice to the entire world.
Via the Internet, it in good time transmitted NATO’s savage acts {baoxing} in the war onto networks, and sent out
reconnaissance information consistent with the identifying characteristics {shibie biaoshi} of its information and
intelligence systems. [end of page 39] At the same time, the FRY fabricated its own battlefield information and
projected false intelligence {jiaqingbao} to deceive the coming enemy. The FRY military also fully exploited NATO’s
abundant Internet information resources, over the ‘Net collected information resources on the weapons and equipment of
all NATO nations which participated in the air raid activities, and thus provided powerful assisting support $\{ zhi yua
n \}$ for its anti-air raid operations. In addition, ever since NATO had first launched air raids against the FRY,
NATO’s official website $\{ gua nfa ngw ang zha n \}$ had constantly suffered attacks by computer hackers $\lbrace hei k
e \rbrace$ . Several computer warriors $\{$ 计算机斗士 jisuanji doushi} of the FRY exploited computer software, sneaked into
NATO’s server connecting to the Internet, and within a short time injected several thousand illicit pieces of
information, which caused problems such as the NATO website appearing to be blocked $\{ dus e \}$ and user access
{yonghu fangwen} having difficulty. NATO’s internal $\{ nei b u \}$ e-mail system also was honored with hacker
[intrusions], and every day it received more than 2000 “electronic bombs” {“dianzi zhadan”} of illicit mail. According
to a NATO spokesperson who declined to reveal his or her name, during the war some of NATO’s computer websites had
suffered heavy losses {zhongchuang} inflicted by computer viruses {jisuanji bingdu} coming from the FRY. News reports
said that FRY computer experts, under the assistance of Russian hackers, had once attacked into the C2 system of the US
Navy’s Nimitz aircraft carrier {“Nimizi” hao hangkong mujian $\}$ , and caused its communication to be out of order $\{
shi lin g \}$ for up to several hours. In addition, the US FBI’s website and other government websites also suffered the
attacks of hackers, causing several websites for long periods to be in a closed status {zhuangtai}. The great network
war $\{ wan glu o \ daz han \}$ which broke out during the Kosovo War broke new records in the operational patterns
within humankind’s recorded history of war. The adoption of multiple means to implement PSYWAR was another prominent
feature of the Kosovo War. The U.S.-led NATO’s tactics $\left\{ cel u e \right\}$ of “troops who subdue the enemy
without battle” {“不战而屈人之兵” “buzhan er quren zhibing”} already had its proponents {情有独钟 qingyou duzhong}, who fully
recognized the principle of “to take the enemy by force, first capture their hearts” {“夺人先夺心” “duoren xian duoxin”}, and
placed PSYWAR in an important position. At the beginning of April [1999], Britain’s Foreign Secretary [Robin] Cook {库克
kuke} in a public address said that the FRY’s First Lady Mila and her children had quietly left Yugoslavia and gone to
another country. This sensational {耸人听闻 songren tingwen} news was transmitted to Yugoslavia, and naturally played a
certain role in confusing the people. This is because if it were really just as Cook had said, then it meant that
Milosevic {米洛舍维奇 miluosheweiqi} had already made preparations for defeat. On 27 May, International Criminal Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia [ICTY] {前南国际战犯法庭 qiannan guoji zhanfan fating} inspector [Louise] Arbour {阿尔切尔 aerqieer} announced
that she was prosecuting for war crimes Milosevic and four other former Yugoslavian leaders. [end of page 40] This also
was a new product of the PSYWAR cooked up {paozhi} by the leaders of the U.S., UK, and other nations. Its intent $\{ yit
u \}$ was unusually clear: to isolate the FRY leaders and to create in them enormous psychological fright {xinli
konghuang}. When carrying out the campaign operations-research-based planning {zhanyi chouhua}, they considered PSYWAR
content and objectives {mubiao} within it. At the start of the air raids, almost 100 personnel of the $4 ^ { \mathrm { t
h } }$ PSYWAR Group {dadui} $[ 4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ PSYOP Group] subordinate to the US Special Operations Command
[SOCOM] {tezhong zuozhan silingbu} at top speed were moved from the U.S. to Italy. Some [members] even penetrated deep
into the Kosovar “Albanian Liberation Army’s” [KLA’s] {科索沃 “阿族 解放军” kesuowo “azu jiefangjun”} controlled area, drew up
{niding} PSYWAR activities courses of action [COAs] {xingdong fang’an}, and conducted a multilevel, fulldimensional
PSYWAR offensive $\{ gon gsh i \}$ against Yugoslavia. First, they set up the “NATO PSYWAR Broadcast TV Station.” This
group recommended that the US Air Force [USAF] dispatch 6 EC-130 aircraft. At an altitude of 10,000 meters, group
personnel exploited the medium-wave and FM bands {zhongbu, tiaopin boduan} used by Yugoslav State radio and TV stations,
and in the Serbian language broadcast PSYWAR information. Next, together with the NATO International Military Staff HQ
{canmoubu} Public Relations Department, as well as related intelligence institutions, they joined hands to prepare
PSYWAR propaganda materials and false information {jiaxinxi}, which they widely sent out to the mass media. In addition,
based on PSYWAR tenets, they recommended strikes on susceptible targets $\{ min gan mub iao \}$ , including the
Yugoslavian president’s official residence and bombing of the Yugoslavian electric power and water supply systems. In
order to keep the Yugoslavian people from timely obtaining true information on the air raids and anti-air raid
[activities], NATO before dawn on 23 April bombed the Yugoslav State TV station, and on the $2 7 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$
it used missiles to destroy the TV broadcasting tower mounted at the top of the Serbian Socialist Party’s HQ building.

The main characteristics of IO at this time were as follows: first is that IO had become an important component of the
joint campaign. IO had become the “first gun” fired in an independent phase of the joint campaign, even before the
launch of the joint campaign’s overall activities {zongti xingdong}; it moreover penetrated from start to finish of the
entire campaign. This [point] had a typical embodiment within the Persian Gulf War and Kosovo War. Second is that IO
technology had produced qualitative leaps: various types of IO weapons had emerged in an endless stream {层出不穷 cengchu
buqiong}, and informationized weapons had become “multipliers” of combat power. During the Kosovo War, the sorties into
action {chudongde jiaci} by the NATO armed forces’ EW aircraft constituted more than $40 \%$ of the total number of
aircraft sent into action. In addition, the “decoys” towed by aircraft conducted air raids, and also acquitted
themselves splendidly during the war. One new type of IO weapon – the EMP bomb [Ebomb] – [end of page 41] saw
application in real combat. Third is the maturation of IO thought and the proposal of integrated {wanzheng} IO theory,
as well as the establishment of the corresponding institutions. Before the Gulf War, studies of IO only involved
individual efforts $\{ xin gwe i \}$ sporadically carried out by theorists within and outside of the militaries of
various nations; but after this war, they then became studies by the nation’s leading [researchers] $\left\{ zhu dao
\right\}$ and efforts of practice. This phase of research on IO further deepened, and also further deepened studies on
fighting methods {zhanfa} for IO.

In 1992, the US Department of Defense issued DoD Directive {zhiling} 3600.1— Information Warfare {xinxizhan}, which
began to study IO theory in key point based, phase-by-phase manner {you zhongdian, fenjieduan di}, and developed IW
capabilities. The fiscal year 1995 US Defense Report carried out a delimiting {jieding} of IO, and the fiscal year 1996
Defense Report at fairly great length discussed IO issues. The US military’s Joint Vision 2010 {2010 nian lianhe
gouxiang} and its accompanying full set of {peitao} trans-century long-range plans $\{ gui hua \}$ for the various
services and arms {junbingzhong} all at very great length discussed the importance and main content of IO. In 1993, DoD
took the lead in carrying out structural adjustment {tiaozheng} of its directly subordinate institutions, and clarified
the duties $\{ zhi z e \}$ of each department in terms of developing IO capabilities. In 1994, it established an
Information Systems Security Center {xinxi xitong anquan zhongxin}, Joint Staff C2 Warfare Center {lianhe canmoubu
zhihui kongzhizhan zhongxin}, and Joint Staff IO Bureau {lianhe canmoubu xinxi zuozhan ju}. The US Army, Navy, and Air
Force respectively established the corresponding IO institutions, and issued the corresponding operational regulations
{zuozhan tiaoling}.

At the same time, all nations of Western Europe – and in particular Britain, France, Germany, and Italy – also were
actively conducting studies on IO and open-up development [exploitation] {kaifa} of IO capabilities, developing
informationized equipment, and building digitized units {shuzihua budui} and digitized battlefields. France and Italy
were exploiting {kaifa} “intelligence and command systems” used for tri-service joint operations {sanjun lianhe
zuozhan}; they also were placing key point investment in building of theater-level command information system {zhanquji
zhihui xinxi xitong} projects, such as NATO airborne C2 systems {kongzhong zhihui kongzhi xitong}. The British Army
{lujun} invested large amounts of funds $\{ zij i n \}$ in building an integrated system {yitihua xitong} for command HQ
$\{ sil ing b u \}$ work, C2, logistics $\{ hou fan gqi nwu \}$ , and combat support $\left\{ zha ndo uzh iyu a n
\right\} .$ . This system would join more than 400 users and 56 stations {zhandian} in the armed forces of the UK and
Germany. The US military held that from the viewpoint of the theoretical development of IO, [end of page 42] first was
for “electronic warfare” to be developed into $^ { 6 6 } C 2$ warfare,” and then to evolve into “information
operations.” C2 warfare on the battlefield would be the entire basis for IO, while EW would be the basic pillar for C2
warfare.

# Section 4: Motive Factors in the Development of Joint Campaign IO…43

Although IO has developed following on the emergence of war, nonetheless for a long time it was not at all recognized by
people; and only with the recent several local wars was it able to attract the wide-ranging attention of people. The
main reasons for this include the following several points.

# I. The inevitable product of IT application…43

The swift development of IT and its wide-ranging application in the military field thus led to IO within modern war
being further developed. The development of IT promoted the informatization $\{ xin xih u a \}$ of the armed forces’ internal weapons and equipment and the
informatization of command modes {zhihui fangshi}. Since the 1990s, the development of weapons and equipment among
nations around the world already has begun to convert to applying modern IT in order to transform and provide an
informationized degree for weapons and equipment. Informationized munitions {danyao}, informationized operational
platforms, military-use intelligent robots, individual digitized equipment {danbing shuzihua zhuangbei}, and networked
{wangluohua} C2 systems have attained very great development. This has caused early warning detection $\{ yuj ing tan c
e \}$ , C2, intelligence communication, firepower strike, battlefield maneuver {jidong}, and logistics support to be
formed into a closely coordinated {miqie xietong} integrated operational SoS {yitihua zuozhan tixi}. The development of
armed forces informatization has maximally boosted the armed forces’ C2 capability, but also is exposing lethal weak
points. The reliance of the armed forces on networked information systems is growing ever greater, and at the same time
it also is becoming a weak vital site {yaohai} for enemy attack. Sabotaging or destroying important network systems
enables creating lethal strikes against the adversary. This then requires that the armed forces not only must strengthen
{jiaqiang} friendly information defense {jifangde xinxi fangyu}, to ensure the security of friendly information and
information systems; they also must actively implement [end of page 43] information offense $\{ xin xij ing ong \}$ , to
sabotage the enemy’s information and information systems. Hence, the position of IO is growing ever higher, and its
influence on the progress {jincheng} and outcome {jieju} of campaign combat {zhanyi zhandou} is growing ever greater.

# II. The inevitable choices for the changes in strategic needs {zhanlue xuqiu}…44

Since the entry into the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century, all of the world’s main military powers have taken as the
objective gaining victory in wars of the Information Age, and have unfolded even sharper arms races. Developing
informationized operations weapons and equipment and building of informationized units have become the inevitable
choices for all nations’ military strategic readjustment {junshi zhanlue tiaozheng}. Around the world, which nation
would think it will go and fight a large-scale war of the type such as the two world wars? Traditional large formations
$\{ dab ing tua n \}$ and large campaigns {da zhanyi} no longer find favor. Having gone through analysis of the Cold War
and deep thinking on the pain and suffering [of large-scale wars], people have begun to gradually shift their attention
onto small-scale wars $\{ xia ozh a n \}$ , and to seek deterrent means {weishe shouduan} and operational capabilities
$\{ zuo zha nne ngl i \}$ more suited to the circumstances of today’s world and to fairly low-level conflicts. This
form, IO, is relatively adapted to this need. The EW and computer network warfare {jisuanji wangluozhan} trial of
strength in the EM field and the struggle on computer fluorescent screens cannot be like two armies facing one another
$\{ lia ngj und uiz hen \}$ , depleting {xiaohao} even more resources and creating even more personnel casualties.
Informationized weapons have the capability for striking point targets {dianzhuang mubiao}, and their kill area
{shashang mianji} can be restricted to within a certain scope. They are also beneficial to reducing the necessary
casualties, and to gaining a great victory at a small cost. Great reduction in casualties is one of the important motive
factors in the development of IO. Hence, under the enormous driving force of strategic needs, IO is seeing rapid,
all-around development.

# III. The necessary result of the world’s Revolution in Military Affairs [RMA] {junshi geming}…44

Since the debut of firearms {rebingqi}, which have undergone development changes of almost a thousand years, their
tactical technical characteristics {战技性能 zhan ji xingneng} already have approached the physical limits. The greatest
feature of the RMA {xin junshi geming} is its wide-ranging employment of IT. The result is that the range (of fire)
{shecheng}, navigation range {hangcheng}, speed, and similar high-tech characteristic performance indices $\{ xin gne
ngz hib iao \}$ of the various types of weapons and operational platforms which have approached the physical limits now
are seeing new development and breakthroughs. The application of IT in the military has brought along enormous benefit,
and has changed the past traditional development mentality $\{ sil u \}$ of purely pursuing the scale of war $\{ zha nzh
eng gui m o \}$ and damage effects {huishang xiaoguo}. In terms of weapons and equipment [end of page 44] technical
composition, it has constantly increased the information processing capability of weapons systems; realized
informatization, smartness {zhinenghua}, and networking {wangluohua} of weapons systems; and brought forth IT-centered
weapons systems such as information munitions $\{ xin xid any a o \}$ , informationized operational platforms,
individual digitized equipment, and command information systems. Thus, it has laid the material foundation for
implementing IO. If we can say that the RMA {junshi jishu geming} has given “new life” to the physical limits of weapons
and equipment, then the “new life” in the weapons and equipment physical limits in turn have caused the theory of war
{zhanzheng lilun} and its patterns and means to undergo qualitative changes, and will hasten the birth of a new type of
operation mode {zuozhan fangshi} – the birth of information operations.

# IV. The inevitable result of rethinking of war goals {zhanzheng mudi} and means…45

Since ancient times, the goals of war have been to wipe out {xiaomie} the enemy and to preserve oneself. To achieve
these goals, for the past almost 200 years, humankind all along has been pursuing boosts in the destructive power
{pohuaili} of war and weapons, and ultimately is developing nuclear, biological, and chemical [NBC] $\{ h e ,$ sheng,
hua} weapons of mass destruction [WMD] {daguimo shashang pohuaixing wuqi}. However, the maximum boosts in the
destructive power of weapons contrarily have formed the factor which restricts their use. As a result, people now are
seeking more “civilized” means of war, which not only reduce the casualties and destruction within war, but also can
similarly achieve the goals of war. Following on the full-speed development of IT and the wide-ranging application of
information weapons systems {xinxi wuqi xitong}, people have realized new achievements in the exploration {tansuo} of
operational modes. In other words, via IO, they are changing the direction of the spearhead of war from attacking cities
and pillaging territory {攻城掠地 gongcheng luedi} to [focusing on] the adversary’s cognitive systems {renzhi xitong}: the information systems for command, communication, control, computers, and intelligence [C4I], and the enemy’s
decision-making groups {juece qunti}. Via operational means with information capability {xinxineng} as the main one,
they ultimately attack the enemy’s knowledge {renshi} and conviction $\{ xin nia n \}$ , forcing the enemy to renounce
the desire to resist $\{ dik ang yiy uan \}$ and thus halt operations, and achieving the war goal of “controlling the
enemy and preserving oneself.” Thus, IO has become a new operational pattern for achieving this war goal. The remarkable
expression of IO during the Persian Gulf War has deepened people’s understanding $\{ ren shi \}$ of the superiority
{youyuexing} of this operational pattern within practice, and this outcome has further catalyzed the formation of this
pattern known as information operations. [end of page 45; end of chapter]

# Chapter 3 Guidance Thought {zhidao sixiang} and Principles of Joint Campaign Information Operations…46

Joint campaign information operations (IO) guidance thought and the principles which should be followed are the basic
foundation for operations-research-based planning {chouhua} and conducting of joint campaign IO. Hence, determining the
correct guidance thought and basic principles is of extremely important significance for setting the correct IO
resolution {dingxia... juexin} and for organizing and implementing IO activities $\{ xin gdo n g \}$ , and even for the
peacetime building of command and armed forces informatization {zhihui jundui xinxihua}.

# Section 1: Guidance Thought…46

Joint campaign IO guidance thought is the concentrated {jizhong} embodiment of the characteristics and laws {tedian
guilyu} of IO, and is the basic foundation for all levels of command of and organizing of IO. The determination of IO
guidance thought not only must comply with the characteristics and laws of IO, but also must comply with our military’s
reality. In particular, within future military struggle {douzheng}, our military’s IO will be faced with the challenge
of a hostile side’s {didui fang} powerful IO strengths $\{ lil ian g \}$ . Only when we best the enemy in planning {高敌一筹
gaodi yichou} in terms of operational guidance {zuozhan zhidao} can we seize and maintain the initiative {zhudongquan}
in IO.

The organizing and implementing of joint campaign IO must take as guidance Mao Zedong’s military thought, Deng
Xiaoping’s thought on armed forces building in the new era, Jiang Zemin’s national defense and armed forces building
{jundui jianshe} thought, and [end of page 46] Hu Jintao’s important descriptions of national defense and armed forces
building under the new circumstances {形势 xingshi}. They must focus on effectively carrying out our military’s historic
mission in the new century and new phase; take the new-era military strategic concept {junshi zhanlue fangzhen} as the
foundation; and abide by the basic guidance thought of “active offense {jiji jingong}, sabotaging networks and severing
the chain {破网断链 powang duanlian}, thorough protection, and seizing and maintaining local information dominance {jubu
zhixinxiquan}.” [This means] concentrating elite {jingrui} IO strengths, and with active initiative {jiji zhudong},
using information offensive activities {xinxi jingong xingdong} to seize the advantage of the first opportunity $\{ xia
nji zhi l i \}$ ; placing key points {zhongdian} on striking and sabotaging the enemy’s reconnaissance and early warning
net {zhencha yujing wang}, command communication net $\{ zhi hui ton gxi nwa n g \}$ , and civilian information
installations $\{ she shi \}$ supporting {zhicheng} the enemy’s operational activities {zuozhan xingdong}, and on
severing the enemy intelligence information chain {qingbao xinxi lian}, command information chain {zhihui xinxi lian},
and weapons control information chain {wuqi kongzhi xinxi lian}; and thoroughly organizing information defense {xinxi
$fan gyu \}$ , ensuring that our information systems {xinxi xitong} correctly bring into play

their effectiveness $\{ xia one n g \}$ and [ensuring] operational information security [INFOSEC] {xinxi anquan}, and
struggling hard to seize and maintain information dominance in the joint campaign’s main operational direction {zhuyao
zuozhan fangxiang}, main battlefield, main phases, and critical time segments {guanjian shijie}, so as to create
favorable conditions for the success of the joint campaign.

# I. Basic connotations…47

“Active offense” is an objective requirement {yaoqiu} for IO in modern war, and is the basic avenue for achieving IO
goals $\{ mud i \}$ . Active offense, within the entire process of joint campaigns, means seizing various favorable time
opportunities $\{$ {时机 shiji}, adopting active IO activities, [seizing the] first opportunity to subdue the enemy
{xianji zhidi}, and struggling hard for the initiative. Active offense is something determined by the special quality
{teshuxing} of the information field $\{ lin gyu \}$ ; that is, it has reflected the general laws of initiative-based
offense which operations emphasize under informationized {xinxihua} conditions. Even more important is that it has
grasped the special requirements of struggle in the information field. In future military struggle, a powerful enemy
inevitably will intervene $\{ \ \land \land jie r u \}$ , and use its own superior strengths {youshi liliang} to conduct
powerful information attacks $\{ xin xij ing ong \}$ . If the weaker {ruoshi} side has a passive {beidong} information
defense, that could make it impossible to defend effectively {防不胜防 fangbu shengfang}, and that side all along would be
in a passive position. If one wants the initiative, one must with initiative launch an attack {zhudong chuji}. Offense
is the best defense; without offensive there is no initiative, and without initiative one cannot gain victory
{zhisheng}. During the Kosovo War, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] {南联盟 nanlianmeng}, even though {jinguan} it
was in [the position of] information inferiority {xinxi lieshi}, nonetheless adopted active offense methods, and
achieved the combat results $\{ zha ngu o \}$ of shooting down an F-117 stealth fighter {yinxing zhandouji} and several
cruise missiles {xunhang daodan}. On the other hand, during the Persian Gulf War {haiwan zhanzheng}, Iraq blindly
[adopted] a passive defense {xiaoji fangyu}; via measures such as camouflage and concealment {weizhuang, yinbi}, [end of
page 47] although it reduced some losses, it nonetheless achieved absolutely no combat results to speak of.

“Sabotaging networks and severing the chain” are the critical links {guanjian huanjie} of IO. Even if it is a powerful
enemy having information superiority {xinxi youshi}, its information systems still are its “soft rib.” “Sabotaging
networks and severing the chain” means the need to seize favorable opportunities for combat {zhanji}; select strike
directions and strike nodes {jiedian}; and synthetically [comprehensively] apply {zonghe yunyong} means such as
electronic jamming {dianzi ganrao}, network attacks $\{ wan glu o \ gon gji \}$ , anti-radiation destruction {fanfushe
cuihui}, and special sabotage-raids {tezhong poxi} − to paralyze {tanhuan} the adversary’s information systems, weaken
the adversary’s information attack capability, and to the maximum extent cause the enemy’s networks to be sabotaged and
their chains to be severed, his command to go out of control {shikong}, his activities to be imbalanced $\{ shi tia o
\}$ , his weapons to lose accuracy {失准 shizhun}, and his psychology to go out of balance $\{ shi hen g \}$ . During the Kosovo War, the US-led NATO units $\{ bud u i \}$ all along had powerful information
superiority, but the FRY actively organized information attacks, and for a time caused the NATO general headquarters $\{
zon gbu \}$ computer network server to be congested $\{ zus e \}$ , leading to a crash. Hence, “sabotaging networks and
severing the chain” are the critical links for weakening the enemy’s information superiority, degrading his
integrated-whole operational capability {zhengti zuozhan nengli}, and changing the IO strength comparison $\{ lil ian
gdu ibi \}$ , and are inevitable choices for seizing local information dominance.

“Rigorous protection” {“yanmi fanghu”} is an important means for protecting friendly {jifang} information systems from
loss. Within joint campaigns, since the information systems are huge and distributed over a wide area, with
interconnection and intercommunication $\{ hul ian hut ong \}$ , the systems are relatively vulnerable $\{ cui ruo \}$ ;
and as long as the critical nodes {guanjian jiedian} of an information system meet with enemy jamming, sabotage, and/or
destruction, the entire system then can be paralyzed. In order to boost survivability {shengcun nengli}, [we] must adopt
rigorous protection measures, to guard against attack and defense going out of balance $\{ gon gfa ngs hih eng \}$ , and
against attending to one while losing sight of the other $\{$ {顾此失彼 guci shibi}.

“Seizing and maintaining local information dominance” is the ultimate goal of IO. In terms of the overall situation of
the campaign {zhanyi quanju}, seizing and maintaining local information dominance within the foreseeable future will be
things difficult to realize. Hence, seizing and maintaining local information dominance in the campaign’s main direction
$\{ zhu yao fan gxi ang \}$ , critical nodes, and important areas {diqu} then will become the focal points of contention
{zhengduo jiaodian} in future joint campaign IO. This then requires that we must, on the basis of active offense and
rigorous protection, concentrate the use {jizhong shiyong} of various types of IO strengths and means, and − in the
campaign operations’ main direction, important zones $\{ diy u \}$ , and critical time segments − to the maximum extent
strip away the adversary’s use and dominance {kongzhiquan} of information. At the same time, we must adopt effective
measures to support {baozhang} the normal operation of friendly information systems, [end of page 48] so as to create
the conditions for seizing the initiative in the joint campaign.

The four aspects of IO guidance thought are a tightly connected {jinmi lianxi} organic integrated whole {youji zhengti}.
“Active offense” is the basic avenue for IO, “sabotaging networks and severing the chain” are the critical links of IO,
“rigorous protection” is the assurance of the security of friendly IO, and “seizing and maintaining local information
dominance” are the ultimate goals of IO.

# II. Basis for establishment…49

Joint campaign IO guidance thought serves as rational knowledge {lixing renshi} of the characteristics and laws of IO
under certain historical conditions, and should have a solid basis in practice and a scientific theoretical foundation.
The guidance thought of “active offense, sabotaging networks and severing the chain, thorough [sic] protection, and
seizing and maintaining local information dominance” is something put forth to focus on objective reality $\{ keg uan \
shi j i \}$ of the current state {xianzhuang} of our military’s IO strengths, as well as of the opponent’s situation. It
not only complies with the general guidance laws $\{ zhi dao \ gui lyu \}$ of modern joint campaigns, but also complies
with the special $\left\{ tes h u \right\}$ guidance laws of our military’s future joint campaign IO command. It
possesses fairly strong epochal features {shidai tezheng} and a very strong scientific quality $\{ kex uex ing \}$ ,
directed [focused] quality {zhenduixing}, and guidance quality {zhidaoxing}.

# (1) Characteristics of IO strength employment

In future local wars under informationized conditions {xinxihua tiaojianxia jubu zhanzheng}, the joint campaign IO
strength composition $\{ lil ian gzu che n g \}$ will have contained Army, Navy, Air Force, Second Artillery, and armed
police units {wujing budui}; IO activities will involve network space, psychological space, electromagnetic [EM] space
{dianci kongjian}, and operational platforms spread all over land bases $\{ luj i \}$ , sea bases $\{ hai j i \}$ , air
bases $\{ kon gji \}$ , and outer space {taikong}, as well as under water; and the IO targets/objectives $\{ mub iao \}$
will be numerous, and their objects $\{ dui xia n g \}$ complex. The joint campaign IO strengths not only must carry out
confrontation {duikang} with the information systems of the enemy facing our joint campaign large formations {zhanyi
juntuan}, but also must jam and sabotage the strategic information systems {zhanlue xinxi xitong} on which his
operations are dependent, and furthermore must sabotage the civilian information installations which support {zhicheng}
his operations. Faced with such strenuous IO missions {xinxi zuozhan $ren w u \}$ , solely relying on professional IO
strengths {zhuanye xinxi zuozhan liliang} will make it difficult to fulfill them. [We] must synthetically apply various
types of operational strengths; achieve a mutual combination of “soft kill” {“ruan shashang”} and “hard destruction”
{“ying cuihui”} strengths, and a mutual combination of professional and non-professional strengths; thoroughly
adjust-coordinate {xietiao} [end of page 49] the IO activities of each space, each type of IO strength, and each
direction; and see that they act in concert with one another {彼此呼应 bici huying} and are organically complementary
{peihe}. In this way, [we] will be able to realize the goals of joint campaign IO, and to seize and maintain local
information dominance.

(2) Basic law of IO taking offense as primary

The establishment of any one type of operational guidance thought always must consider the basic characteristics and
inherent laws of the operational activities which it guides. In future local wars under informationized conditions, a
powerful enemy’s intervention in the information field will be unavoidable; and faced with the enemy’s powerful
information attacks, a passive information defense inevitably will [make it] impossible to defend effectively. Hence,
active offense is the key to weakening the enemy’s information superiority. In an enemy having information superiority,
the information systems precisely will be his weak points. If [we] can apply powerful information attack means to
effectively sabotage the information systems on which the enemy heavily relies, then his high-tech superiority with
information superiority as its core may then be greatly weakened. Just as in the nuclear era, when only relying on the
“three defenses” {“sanfang”} [protection against nuclear, biological, and chemical threats] could not break through the
enemy’s nuclear blackmail $\{ h e \ ezh a \}$ , and only by having developed offensive nuclear weapons {jingongxing he
wuqi} and having formed powerful nuclear deterrence {he weishe} were [we] able to keep the enemy from daring to rashly
use nuclear weapons − similarly, only by energetically developing IO means, and forming effective information warfare
[IW] deterrence $\{ xin xiz han ~ wei she \}$ and real combat capability $\{ shi zha nne ngl i \}$ , can [we] force the
enemy to dare not act rashly and blindly {轻举妄动 qingju wangdong}. Although in terms of overall strength comparison
{zongti liliang duibi} our profession IO strengths are in the inferior position, nonetheless we have adequate IO
potential {qianli}, have rich high-tech talent superiority {rencai youshi}, have flexible {linghuo jidong} people’s war
{renmin zhanzheng} IO fighting methods $\{ zha n f \tilde { a } \}$ , and have constantly developing IO strengths and
means. All of these have provided assurances of implementing active information offense.

(3) Objective current state where the enemy is strong and we are weak in IO strengths

Subjective guidance complying with objective reality is a basic requirement for establishing operational guidance
thought. In future local wars under informationized conditions, the quantity of our military’s IO strengths will be
limited, the equipment gap {zhuangbei chaju} will be fairly large, and real combat experience will be insufficient. The
building of specialized psychological warfare [PSYWAR] {xinlizhan} and computer network warfare [CNW] {jisuanji
wangluozhan} strengths is just getting started, and the situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak in IO
strengths will [end of page 50] be present for a long period, so the desire to seize and maintain information dominance
in terms of the overall situation of the campaign will be very difficult [to realize]. However, at the same time, we
also have mastered some “assassin’s mace” weapons {“shashoujian” wuqi} in the information field, have [realized] fairly
many achievements in terms of theoretical innovation of IO fighting methods, and have possessed the capability for
seizing and maintaining local information dominance. This objective situation is an important basis which must be given
close attention in establishing our military’s joint campaign IO guidance thought. Concentrating the employment of elite {jingrui} IO strengths in these two main operational patterns {zuozhan yangshi}, EW and CNW;
conducting active initiative-based information offensive operational activities, to bring into play the backbone role
$\{ zuo yon g \}$ of our military’s limited IO strengths; striving to change weakness into strength; using strong points
to attack weak points {以长击短 yichang jiduan}; taking the initiative; and positioning the campaign IO goal on seizing
local information dominance − these precisely are based on the basic reality of the enemy being strong while we are weak
in future joint campaign IO strengths, and are grounded in operations under the most complex and most difficult
conditions.

Hence, we must want to establish the thought of “seizing and maintaining local information dominance;” on the basis of
“active offense” and “rigorous protection,” concentrate the employment of various IO strengths and means in the campaign
operations’ main direction, important zones, and critical time segments; take seizing and maintaining local information
superiority as the direct operational goal; execute powerful information attacks against the enemy’s main information
systems; and to the maximum extent strip away his use and dominance of information. At the same time, [we must] adopt
effective measures to support the normal operation of friendly information systems, so as to create favorable conditions
for seizing the initiative in joint campaign operations.

(4) Experience in the practice {shijian jingyan} of IO

Theory originates in practice. IO theory − and especially IO guidance thought serving as the core content of IO theory −
is no exception. With regard to this type of entirely new operational activities known as IO, our military, although
lacking in operational practice, nonetheless has felt its way $\{ mos u o \}$ and amassed certain training experience
{xunlian jingyan}. In recent years, our military has regarded IO as important content in joint campaign exercises $\{
yan x i \}$ , repeatedly has organized specialized campaign EW exercises {dianzi duikang yanxi} [end of page 51] and CNW
exercises, and in depth has launched theoretical research {kaizhan lilun yanjiu}; these have realized a good many
valuable achievements. What must be seen is that within the high-tech local wars since the Persian Gulf War, foreign
militaries have acquired much experience in the successful practice of joint campaign IO. Examples include active
offense, preemption {xianfa zhiren}, tight combination {jinmi jiehe} of attack and defense activities {gongfang
xingdong}, simultaneous use of “soft” and “hard” means, mutual complementation of technology and tactics {jishu zhanshu
xianghu peihe}, and implementation of integrated operations {yitihua zuozhan}. All these are useful references for
establishing our military’s joint campaign IO guidance thought. The IO guidance thought put forth in this text
specifically focuses on absorbing the experience of our military’s training exercises and the achievements of
theoretical research. In a manner providing analysis and distinction, it draws upon the foreign militaries’ operational
experience; tightly combines this with our military’s reality and the needs and requirements of future military
struggle; carries out abstraction {chouxiang} of the core content of operational guidance, including the main patterns
and main-force activities which should be adopted in joint campaign IO and the basic goals to be achieved; and as much
as possible uses simple and easily understood language to summarize and form [this IO guidance thought]. This then
organically unifies the means and the goals. That is, it has emphasized the core thought and important content, has
avoided devoting attention to all aspects of the matter {面面俱到 mianmian judao}, and also is easy to understand and grasp;
it has the distinct characteristics our military.

(5) Basic guidance thought and principles of the joint campaign

Joint campaign IO is an important component {zucheng bufen} of a joint campaign. Hence, joint campaign IO guidance
thought must take the joint campaign’s basic guidance thought and principles as its theoretical foundation. Our
military’s Joint Campaign Guidelines {lianhe zhanyi gangyao} has established the joint campaign basic guidance thought
of “integrated-whole operations and key point strikes {zhengti zuozhan, zhongdian daji},” and has put forth 10
principles, including “knowing the enemy and knowing yourself {知彼知己 zhibi zhiji}, and striving for subjective guidance
complying with objective reality.” Its mental essence {jingshen shizhi} is to set out from the actual situation of the
enemy and friendly sides {diwo shuangfang} and the battlefield’s objective environment; fully bring into play the
integrated-whole operational might {zhengti zuozhan weili} of all services and arms $\{ zhu jun bin gzh ong \}$ , as
well as of other participating strengths {canzhan liliang}; and apply flexible, effective fighting methods to execute
key point strikes against the vital site positions $\{ yao hai buw e i \}$ and weak links of the enemy’s operational
system of systems [SoS] {zuozhan tixi}. This is the direct theoretical foundation for establishing our military’s joint
campaign IO guidance thought. The IO guidance thought put forth in this text specifically focuses on [end of page 52]
all-around embodiment of joint campaign basic guidance thought and principles, and tightly combines these with IO
characteristics, to creatively implement and apply them. The grounding in the joint campaign’s overall situation, as
emphasized by this guidance thought, takes seizing of local information dominance as creating the conditions for success
in the joint campaign. It actively implements offense, executes key point strikes against the enemy’s command and
control [C2] systems {zhihui kongzhi xitong}, carries out rigorous protection of our military’s information systems, and
works hard to realize the tight combination of information offense and information defense. It takes EW and CNW as the
leading factors $\left\{ zhu dao \right\}$ , mainly uses the various types of IO strengths in these two patterns,
synthetically applies the various patterns of IO, and fully brings into play the basic connotations, such as
integrated-whole operational might. All this is tightly linked up {xianjie} with the joint campaign’s basic guidance
thought and principles, and brought together with them for a thorough understanding of the subject {融会贯通 ronghui
guantong}; and its mental essence is entirely consistent.

# III. Issues which should be grasped in implementing and applying joint campaign IO guidance thought…53

(1) Establishing new concepts {guannian}

Establishing the joint campaign IO guidance thought of “active offense, sabotaging networks and the chain, thorough
protection, and seizing and maintaining local information dominance” means adapting to the new circumstances of IO and
to the needs and requirements of new missions, and is the result of fully advancing with the times {与时俱进 yushi jujin}
and of theoretical innovation. To implement and apply this guidance thought, [we] must establish new concepts, and
constantly deepen the understanding of the important position and important role of IO. In the transitional period
{zhuanxing qi} of our military’s dual historic mission to complete mechanization and building of informatization, and to
realize modern leap-forward development $\{ kua yue shi faz han \}$ , if our thought concepts are not developed and not
renewed, and remain stuck in the old thinking mode {siwei moshi} of mechanized and semimechanized war, then we cannot
calmly respond to the enormous conflicts and profound changes which IO has introduced into modern war. Before us are the
urgent needs and requirements to break free from the shackles of old thought and old concepts, and to establish new
concepts for IO. First is the need to establish the concept that information is an important combat power {zhandouli}.
In this period, the practice of several local wars fully proves that information already has become an important factor
$\{ yin s u \}$ in armed forces building and development, and is a “multiplier” {“beizengqi”} of combat power. Having
deviated from information, force-strengths $\{ bin gli \}$ , firepower, and maneuver {jidong} then cannot be effectively
[end of page 53] organized and implemented, and will have even more difficulty in bringing into play their roles and
forming integratedwhole operational capability. Second is the need to establish the concept of information going ahead
of the rest {先行 xianxing}. As the saying goes: food and fodder should go before troops and horses {兵马未动, 粮草先行 bingma
weidong, liangcao xianxing} [i.e., proper preparations should be made in advance]. Today, then, is [the time for]
information to go ahead of the rest, and IO already has become the “forerunner” {“xianxingzhe”} of modern local war.
Information preparations going before those of the other operational essential factors $\{ zuo zha nya osu \}$ , viz.,
force-strengths, firepower, and maneuver, and IO activities going before other operational activities, already have
become a [sic] prominent characteristic of modern high-tech local war. Third is the need to establish the concept that
information superiority is the operational initiative {zuozhan zhudongquan}. Information superiority is the most
fundamental, most central operational superiority, and by having information superiority, quantitative [numerical]
superiority, scale superiority $\{ gui moy ous h i \}$ , and tempero-spatial superiority $\{ shi kon gyo ush i \}$ then
have significance. It is just as comrade Jiang Zemin once pointed out: “Within local war, without information dominance,
one cannot then speak of sea dominance {zhihaiquan} [command of the seas] and air dominance/supremacy {zhikongquan}.”
Without effective control of and the free use of information, [we] similarly cannot seize and maintain the initiative in
joint campaigns.

(2) Correctly processing three relationships

To implement and apply joint campaign IO guidance thought, [we] must properly process several important relationship
issues relating to the overall situation of the campaign and its outcome {jieju}. Among these it is especially necessary
to devote attention to and properly process relationships in three respects: “between the integrated whole and the parts
$\{ jub u \}$ , between offense and defense, and between centralization and decentralization $\{ jiz hon gyu fen san \}$
.” First is properly processing the relationship between the integrated whole and the parts. Within joint campaigns, on
one hand, [we] must properly process the relationship of the IO part to the joint campaign’s integrated whole. IO serves
as an important component of joint campaigns, and must be subordinate to and in the service of the overall situation of
the entire campaign. On the other hand, [we] also must properly process the relationship of the various components of IO
to the integrated whole of IO. IO is composed of essential factors, including multiple strengths, patterns, and
activities; so [we] not only must lay stress on the special quality of these essential factors and bring into play their
important roles, but also must ensure that all of them can be unfolded {zhankai} to center around this integrated whole
of IO. Second is properly processing the relationship of offense to defense. The active offense required by joint
campaign IO guidance thought is established on the basis of thorough defense, and is not at all a belittling and/or
exclusion {paichi} of information defense. The actual situation of our military’s IO strengths and weapons and equipment
[end of page 54] has determined that offense and defense must be tightly combined, and that we cannot purely emphasize
information offense, nor can we passively organize information defense. Instead, [we] should accomplish having defense
within offense, having offense within defense, using offense to assist defense, and using defense to promote offense, to
jointly bring into play their proper operational effectiveness $\{ zuo zha nxi aon eng \}$ for seizing campaign local
information dominance. Third is properly processing the relationship of centralization to decentralization.
Centralization and decentralization within joint campaign IO are a unity of opposites $\{ dui lit ong y i \}$ . Our
military’s IO strengths are weak, and in terms of organizational structure $\{ bia nzh i \}$ they are also decentralized
in units of the various services and arms. During operations, they must be unified in organization and centralized in
employment, to form fists. Centralization mainly signifies the centralization of IO capabilities, and is not the
centralization of force-strengths and weapons {bingli bingqi} in the traditional sense. At the same time, [we] also must
consider timely decentralized disposition $\{ fen san \ bus h u \}$ of IO strengths and equipment, and avoid centralized
deployment {jizhong peizhi} due to spatial [needs], which would create losses in strengths.

(3) Laying stress on bringing into play the integrated-whole might of IO

The ultimate implementation of joint campaign IO guidance thought must rely on the effective bringing into play of the
integrated-whole might among all strengths, all means, all activities, and all battlefields of IO. To this end, [we]
should conscientiously do a good job of combination in the following four respects. First is the mutual combination of
professional strengths and nonprofessional strengths. The EW and network warfare [CNW] units (elements) $\{ b u \ ( fen ) \ dui \}$ subordinate to the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Second
Artillery Corps are professional strengths engaged in IO, and are the main body of IO; they undertake $\{ dan fia \}$
the main operational missions {zuozhan renwu} and bring into play the main roles. Beyond these, the IO nonprofessional
strengths also are indispensable important components of the integrated-whole strength of IO. The two each have their
strong points, and they should be organically combined, for integrated-whole subduing of the enemy $\{ zhe ngt izh idi
\}$ . Second is the mutual combination of armed forces strengths will local strengths {difang liliang}. Joint campaign
IO requires the energetic support $\{ zhi chi \}$ and active participation of the masses. This special operational field
has provided a vast battlefield for local information strengths to participate in and bring into play a role. IO should
fully exploit the information resources of the local rich talent, technology, and installations, and in different
operational spaces $\{ zuo zha nko ngj ian \}$ and fields realize integrated operations {yiti zuozhan} of military-local
information strengths {jundi xinxi liliang}. Third is the mutual combination of IO activities and other operational
activities. [end of page 55] Within joint campaigns, the tight connection between IO and other operational activities is
an organic integrated whole. The combining of IO activities together with other operational activities must, while
actively bringing into play the might of the IO activities themselves, excel at drawing aid from the effects of other
operational activities, so as to serve the seizing of campaign local information dominance. Fourth is the mutual
combination of the tangible battlefields with the intangible battlefields. IO with network and electronic [warfare]
{wangdian} as primary mainly is carried out on the intangible battlefields, such as in network space and in the EM
spectrum field {dianci pinpu lingyu}, and is greatly different in comparison to the force-strengths and firepower on the
traditional tangible battlefields, with their “glint and flash of cold steel” {“刀光剑影” “daoguang jianying”} and “floating
clouds of smoke” {“硝烟弥漫” “xiaoyan miman”}. The combination of the tangible battlefields with the intangible battlefields
means the need to use “quiet” $\{ \stackrel { \ldots } { jij ing } ^ { \prime \prime } \}$ or invisible CNW, EW, and
PSYWAR, along with fierce firepower warfare and special operations {tezhong zuozhan}, mutually complemented, and
adjusted-coordinated consistently to strike at the enemy, and protect oneself.

(4) Working hard to innovate IO fighting methods

In implementing and applying joint campaign IO guidance thought, innovating a set of effectual fighting methods is
especially important. Laying stress on innovating fighting methods and excelling at innovating fighting methods not only
are a superiority of our military, but also are traditions of our military. Innovating fighting methods within joint
campaign IO requires having new trains of thought $\{ sil u \}$ and new measures. First is the need to innovate in terms
of the combination of tactics and technology. In the history of war in ancient and modern times, both in China and
abroad, the most effective fighting methods without exception have been {无一不是 wuyi bushi} the products of the optimum
combination {zuijia jiehe} of tactics and technology. In innovating fighting methods in terms of the combination of
tactics and technology, what is most important is the need to have a deep understanding of and scientific attitude
toward the performance and characteristics of information technology [IT] {xinxi jishu} and its equipment {zhuangbei}, as well as of the important influence they have had on modern operations − and, on this basis, to boldly
explore $\{ tan suo \}$ the methods used and the handling measures, and work hard to create new fighting methods
complying with the requirements of IT and its equipment and adapting to our military’s situation. Second is the need to
innovate in terms of the combination of high technology and general technology. At present, although our military
possesses several IO “assassin’s mace” weapons and equipment, nonetheless much more in evidence is general-technology
weapons and equipment. Hence, how to use low-tech to defeat high-tech {以低制高 yidi zhigao} and how to use indigenous
methods to defeat foreign methods {以土制洋 yitu zhiyang} are the basic footholds {lizudian} for innovation of IO fighting
methods. On one hand, [we] must conscientiously study effective measures for bringing into play the might of the
“assassin’s mace” weapons, [end of page 56] to fully bring into play the effectiveness of the limited high- and new-tech
weapons and equipment. On the other hand, even more important is to find ways and means {想方设法 xiangfang shefa} to seek
new avenues for bringing into play the might and employment of the large quantities of general-technology weapons and
equipment we possess, so that they produce new combat power. At the same time, [we] also must concentrate our efforts
{下功夫 xia $gon g \hat { \mu } \rbrace$ and write articles on the combination of “assassin’s mace” weapons and
generaltechnology weapons and equipment, so that the two superiorities are complementary {youshi hubu} and form a
composite strength {heli}. Third is the need to innovate in terms of the combination of “soft” and “hard” means. During
the Kosovo War and Iraq War, the practice $\{ zuo f a \}$ of the US military − whereby it mutually combined “soft” means
such as network attacks and electronic jamming with “hard” means such as precision strike {jingque daji}, and thus
seized and maintained battlefield information dominance − is worth our drawing upon for reference. [We] must bring into
play the respective strong points of the two means, for jointly defeating the enemy.

# Section 2: Operational Principles…57

The basic principles of joint campaign IO are the basic criteria $\left\{ zhu nze \right\}$ for embodying joint campaign
IO laws and for guiding joint campaign IO activities. Under circumstances where the enemy is strong and we are weak $\{
diy ouw oli e \}$ in overall terms of IO weapons and equipment, upholding the IO principles which have our military’s
characteristics and are scientific will have extremely important significance for guiding our military’s future joint
campaign IO activities and for effectively bringing into play the maximum operational effectiveness.

# I. Requirements for formulating IO principles…57

Within our military’s future joint campaigns, IO will penetrate from start to finish of entire campaigns, and will have
important influences on the campaigns. [We] must conscientiously study joint campaign IO laws under informationized war
conditions, comprehensively analyze {quanmian fenxi} the strong and weak points of our future operational opponents in
terms of IT[-based] weapons and informationized operations theory, and combine these with our military’s present IO capabilities and future joint campaign characteristics, to
formulate joint campaign [end of page 57] IO basic principles having our military’s characteristics, so as to enhance
the directed [focused] quality and effectiveness of our military’s future joint campaign IO activities guidance. When
formulating the basic principles for joint campaign IO, [we] mainly should be based on the following several aspects:

(1) Implementing joint operations thought {lianhe zuozhan sixiang}

Joint gaining of victory {lianhe zhisheng} is a basic characteristic and law within modern war. In particular, several
local wars which have occurred around the world since the 1990s even more fully have proven this point. Following on the
development of IT, integrated $\{ yit ihu a \}$ information systems have provided even more advanced means for joint
campaigns, and have enabled the land, sea, air, space, and EM multidimensional $\{ l u ,$ hai, kong, tian, dian duowei}
operational strengths, via rapid and effective information linkup $\{ gou ton g \}$ , to achieve integrated-whole
operational effectiveness {zhengti zuozhan xiaoneng}. Joint campaign IO activities too are like this. If [we] desire to
achieve the goals of sabotaging the enemy’s information and information systems and protecting friendly information
capabilities, [we] must in a thorough and careful manner adjust-coordinate and apply the IO strengths of the three
services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) and the Second Artillery Corps, as well as of other support units, and “hard” and
“soft” IO means distributed over the 5-dimensional battlespace {wuwei zhanchang kongjian}, to form integrated-whole or
local information superiority over the enemy, and − while ensuring the multiplication of friendly combat power − cause
the demultiplication {倍减 beijian} of the enemy’s integrated-whole combat power.

(2) Laying stress on seizing and maintaining local information dominance

The goal of joint campaign IO is to synthetically apply various IO strengths, via a series of IO activities, so as to
seize and maintain battlefield local information dominance. Hence, within operations-research-based planning and
organizing of joint campaign IO, [we] must from start to finish focus on this ultimate objective {mubiao}: seizing and
maintaining battlefield local information dominance. In this way [we] can effectively adjust-coordinate and fully grasp
the various types of relationships within joint campaign IO; achieve the mutual complementation of information offense
and information defense; adjust-coordinate the application of soft kill and hard destruction means; and achieve mutual
supplementation {相辅相成 xiangfu xiangcheng} among EM space, network space, and psychological space.

(3) Combining [the above] with the actual situation of our military’s IO building

Our military’s IO building got started fairly late. Although in recent years [we] have accelerated the development
steps, [end of page 58] and in some fields have achieved prominent results, nonetheless from the overall viewpoint our
military’s IO strengths in qualitative and quantitative respects still show a fairly large gap compared to the military
powers. [Our] battlefield information reconnaissance $\{ xin xiz hen cha \}$ , early warning, communication, IW {xinxi
duikang}, and information defense capabilities overall still are relatively weak. We must have a clear-headed
understanding {renshi} of this. However, war always has been a comprehensive trial of strength in strengths and wisdom
{智慧 zhihui}, and on the basis of certain material strengths, the subjective dynamic quality $\{ zhu gua n ~ nen gdo ngx
ing \}$ of war guidance has an extremely important role. Our military’s future joint campaign IO also must uphold this
guidance thought. On one hand, [we] must be grounded in our actual national conditions and military conditions, and be
grounded in fighting battles with the equipment we have {有什么装备 打什么仗 you shenme zhuangbei da shenme zhang}; and cannot
simply and mechanically crack the hard nuts $\{ pen gyi n g \}$ with a powerful enemy. Instead, [we] must fully draw
upon and develop IO theory having our military’s characteristics, uphold “we’ll let you fight your way, and we’ll fight
our way” {“nida nide, woda wode”}, and to the maximum extent bring into play the strong points of our IO strengths. On
the other hand, [we] must lay the fullest stress on fully bringing into play the elite troops and efficient instruments
{jingbing liqi} of our military’s IO, and under circumstances of overall inferiority $\{ ruo shi \}$ , take care in the
important phases and time segments to concentrate force-strengths and weapons, to form local superiority over the enemy,
and achieve the IO effects of sabotaging the enemy nodes and paralyzing the enemy SoS.

(4) Aiming at {miaozhun} future operational opponents

The joint campaigns carried out by our military in the future will be countersecessionist {fanfenlie},
counter-interventionist $\{ fan gan y u \}$ , multi-service and arm joint campaigns conducted in order to maintain $\{
wei h u \}$ national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The main operational opponent in recent years has shown
fairly rapid development in the building of information strengths; organized and built professional IO units;
accelerated development of IO equipment; numerous times conducted IO exercises with us as the imaginary enemy; and
attained fairly strong operational capabilities in reconnaissance and early warning, EW, and network warfare [CNW]
respects. The neighboring country on the southwest border, in order to realize the strategic goal {zhanlue mudi} of
seeking hegemony {称霸 chengba} in Southern Asia, has constantly strengthened its military real power {junshi shili}. In
recent years, it has especially attached importance to bringing into play its native IT and talent superiorities,
strengthened military technical cooperation with the West, and attached importance to self-development {自研 ziyan} of IO
weapons; and its integrated-whole IO capability already has attained a substantial level. In addition, the
informationized levels {xinxihua shuiping} of the world’s military powers all along have been in a leading position, and
in IO respects already [end of page 59] have attained full-dimensional reconnaissance and surveillance [R&S] {全维侦监
quanwei zhenjian} and accurate real-time reconnaissance and early warning capabilities; high-integration-level
{jichengdu gao}, rapid and highefficiency information transmission and processing {xinxi chuandi he chuli} capability;
information offense capability having both soft and hard [means] {软硬兼备 ruanying jianbei} and a combination of points and
areas {dianmian jiehe}; and peacetime-wartime integrated {pingzhan yiti}, jam-resistant and destruction-resistant
{kangrao, kanghui} information defense capability. [Moreover, the military powers’] IW {xinxizhan} and precision warfare {jingquezhan}
already have gradually taken over the leading position within their future operational activities, and within several
recent local wars have attained full development. Hence, on the background of a powerful enemy’s possible intervention,
future joint campaign IO will be faced with severe challenges. This then requires that we pay close attention to
developing advanced IO strengths, conscientiously study our future operational opponents, draw upon their experience and
strong points, analyze their inadequacies and weak points, and formulate and adopt effective countermeasures $\{ dui c e
\}$ . Only by knowing the enemy and yourself $\{ zhi jiz hib i \}$ can you fight a hundred battles with no danger of
defeat {baizhan budai}, and within future military struggle be in an invincible [position] {liyu bubai}.

# II. Content of the basic principles of IO…60

The content of the basic principles of joint campaign IO is as follows: full preparations and thorough
operations-research-based planning; unified command {tongyi zhihui} and close coordination {miqie xietong};
concentration of the elite $\lbrace jin gru i \rbrace$ , to attack enemy vital sites; concealment and surprise {yinbi
turan}, and [seizing] the first opportunity to subdue the enemy; and rigorous protection, to ensure security.

(1) Full preparations and thorough operations-research-based planning

Full preparations and thorough operations-research-based planning signify, in peacetime and in the imminent battle
preparation phase {linzhan zhunbei jieduan}, thoroughly and ably performing all items of the preparatory work for IO,
including theoretical research, exploitation $\{ kai f a \}$ of technology, cultivation (training) of talent {rencai
peiyang}, battlefield and unit building, formulation of plans $\{ jih u a \}$ , and readiness training {zhanbei
xunlian}. In wartime, based on the joint campaign’s actual situation, the commander’s {zhihuiyuan} operational intent
$\{ zuo zha nyi t u \}$ , the IO missions, and the task organization {biancheng} situation of the IO strengths, [command
personnel] carry out integrated-whole operations-research-based planning and working out an approach in planning
{zhengti chouhua yu mouhua} for all types of IO strengths and IO activities, take all things into consideration {通盘考虑
tongpan kaolyu}, and do unified operations-research-based planning of arrangements {tongchou anpai}, to see that IO
becomes an organic component of the joint campaign. Under circumstances where our military’s IO weapons and equipment
will be in an inferior position compared to a powerful enemy, via in-advance {yuxian} full preparations and thorough
operationsresearch-based planning, [we] can reduce the gap with the opponent, as rapidly as possible change the inferior
position into a superior position, and thus lay a solid foundation for defeating the enemy. These are prerequisites
{qianti tiaojian} for ensuring that joint campaign IO is smoothly [end of page 60] implemented.

In implementing the principle of full preparations and thorough operationsresearch-based planning, first is that
[command personnel] should fully exploit favorable conditions for peacetime IO preparations, and strengthen {jiaqiang}
and perfect the building of IO battlefields and strengths in the main direction and key point areas {zhongdian diqu}. Second is
synthetically applying multiple information reconnaissance means to understand and grasp the enemy IO-related situation.
Third is, based on the joint campaign operational courses of action [COAs] $\{ zuo zha nfa n g ^ { \prime } a n \}$ ,
thoroughly formulating IO plans; based on the operational missions and the battlefield environment, organizing imminent
battle preparations in a manner having a directed [focused] quality; doing a good job of IO preparations and materiel
preparations $\{ wuz izh unb e i \}$ ; in a deep and careful manner, ably performing the thought and political work of
the IO units; and carrying out the mobilization $\{ don gyu a n \}$ and organizational work for the participation
{canzhan} of the local IO strengths. Fourth is, after receiving the operational missions, swiftly, comprehensively, and
accurately grasping the IO-related battlefield situation, doing thorough operations-research-based planning for IO
activities, with the key points on clarifying the IO goals, main targets/objectives, basic fighting methods, and
operational disposition $\{ zuo zha n \ bus h u \}$ ; carrying out scientific organization and allocation $\{ bia npe i
\}$ and combination of the IO strengths, and forming a SoS of IO strengths, deployed properly, mutually linked up $\{
xia ngh uxi anj i e \}$ , and distributed rationally $\{ buj uhe l i \}$ ; correctly formulating the IO objectives, time
opportunities, spatial domain $\{ kon gyu \}$ , and frequency domain $\{ pin y u \}$ , and thoroughly formulating the IO
plans; and thoroughly organizing the coordination and support, to boost the IO effectiveness.

# (2) Unified command and close coordination

Unified command and close coordination signify applying advanced command means {zhihui shouduan} to put into effect
integrated command {yitihuade zhihui} of all participating services and arms and local IO strengths; to strengthen the
coordination of the main battlefield and main direction, as well as of the main-battle large formations {zhuzhan
juntuan} and IO strengths; and to ensure [the conduct of] activities under the unified campaign intent {tongyide zhanyi
yitu} and objectives. The joint campaign IO strength composition {liliang goucheng} is complex, the operational methods
and means are diversified, and the fields involved are expansive and tightly combined with other operational activities.
Only by putting into effect highly centralized and unified command {jizhong tongyide zhihui} and close coordination can
[command personnel] ensure that the various strengths of joint campaign IO from start to finish center on the overall
situation of the campaign [and] are adjusted-coordinated consistently in their activities.

In implementing the principle of unified command and close coordination, first is the need to use the IO [end of page
61] guidance thought to unify the IO activities of all services and arms, and see that all units’ IO activities tightly
center on the unfolding of the IO goals. Second, according to the requirements for authoritativeness $\{ qua nwe i \}$ ,
eliteness $\{ jin gga n \}$ , agility $\{ lin gbi a n \}$ , and high efficiency $\{ gao xia o \}$ , is establishing
integrated $\{ yit ihu a \}$ joint campaign IO command institutions $\{ zhi hui jig o u \}$ , clarifying the command
relationships $\{ zhi hui gua nxi \}$ and command authority limits $\{ zhi hui$ quanxian}, unifying the organization and
use of the IO strengths, doing unified operations-research-based planning {tongyi chouhua} for the activities of the
subordinate

IO units, and fully bringing into play the integrated-whole effectiveness of the various IO strengths and operational
activities; relying on the campaign command information systems to perfect the IO command network, and to ensure the
smoothness and high efficiency of IO command; and, based on the battlefield situation, flexibly {linghuo} adopting the
corresponding command modes {zhihui fangshi}. Third, based on the characteristics of the various IO strengths, is
properly {qiadang} entrusting the missions. Based on the joint campaign IO resolution $\{ xin xiz uoz han jue xin \}$ ,
the IO plans, and the higher-level coordination instructions {shangji xietong zhishi}, [this involves] thoroughly
formulating the IO coordination plan; clarifying the coordination relationships, methods, and requirements; particularly
organizing electronic jamming and network attack activities; ably adjusting-coordinating the attack directions, targets,
and time opportunities; and avoiding causing jamming of friendly information and information systems. Fourth, with
planned coordination {jihua xietong} as primary, and based on developing changes in the IO posture {xinxi zuozhan
taishi}, is timely organizing ad hoc coordination {linji xietong}, strengthening coordination support, and formulating
recovery COAs when coordination suffers sabotage, to maintain uninterrupted {bujianduan} coordination.

(3) Concentrating the elite, to attack the enemy vital sites

Concentrating strengths to attack the enemy vital sites signifies, within a certain time, accurately selecting the enemy
information system’s weak links and critical nodes, concentrating use of elite information offensive strengths, and
implementing continuous attacks $\{ lia nxu gon gji \}$ , to achieve the goals of effectively sabotaging the enemy
information systems and reducing {减煞 jiansha} the enemy’s operational capability.

In implementing the principle of concentrating the elite to attack the enemy vital sites, first, based on joint campaign
IO requirements, combined with the situation of the IO strengths, is assembling {diaoji} the elite strengths for
strategic and campaign {zhanlue zhanyi} IO, and weaving them into the joint campaign large formations, to enhance IO
capability. Second is concentrating the IO elite strengths in the main operational direction, main battlefield, main
phases, and critical time segments, to form local superiority. Third is meticulously selecting the enemy’s important
networks, [end of page 62] critical nodes, and weak links; forming a powerful information offense posture; flexibly
applying soft and hard strike means and methods; and implementing key point strikes, to paralyze, sabotage, and $[ /
\mathrm { o r } ]$ weaken the enemy information system functions $\{ gon gne n g \}$ . Fourth, on the basis of an
all-around grasp and understanding of the enemy information system’s weak links and critical nodes, is comprehensively
considering the feasibility and effectiveness of realizing the objectives, and determining the key point strike targets.
Fifth is the need to timely track and understand the execution situation for the information offense activities,
evaluate-appraise {pinggu} the strike and sabotage effects, achieve “real-time control $\{ shi shi zha ngk ong \}$ ,”
and watch the situation to effect adjustments {tiaozheng} to the offensive strengths and intensity.

(4) Concealment and surprise and [seizing] the first opportunity to subdue the enemy

Concealment and surprise and [seizing] the first opportunity to subdue the enemy signify synthetically applying various
methods and means to conceal the IO intent and activities; deceive and confuse {qipian mihuo} the enemy; and strive at
times, places, and targets unimaginable to the enemy to concentrate information offense strengths, execute surprise
attacks, and restrict the enemy in a passive position.

In implementing the principle of concealment and surprise and [seizing] the first opportunity to subdue the enemy, first
is fully and ably carrying out the IO preparations, formulating multiple contingency preliminary COAs $\{ yin gji y u ^
{ \prime } a n \}$ , and ensuring at any time the conduct of IO activities. Second, based on the battlefield situation,
is selecting and creating opportunities for combat, and striving to launch an information attack before the enemy and to
maintain the battlefield initiative. Third is adopting strict secrecy {baomi} measures to conceal the IO intent. [This
means] strengthening strict management of information systems and IO equipment, conducting secrecy education for
personnel involved with secrets {shemi renyuan} [i.e., cleared personnel], and guarding against the occurrence of cases
of careless and other leaks of secrets {shi, xiemi shijian}. Fourth is attaching importance to using information
deception {xinxi qipian} means; concealing the true and displaying the false {yinzhen shijia} with respect to the
friendly operational intent, disposition, and activities; and [thus] achieving the goals of confusing and moving
{diaodong} the enemy and causing the enemy errors in judgment and decision-making {panduan, juece}. Fifth is grasping
the battlefield situation and the changes in the IO posture, and from start to finish maintaining the advantage of the
first opportunity.

# (5) Rigorous protection, to ensure security

Rigorous protection to ensure security signifies, based on the characteristics of enemy information offense, adopting
protective measures in a manner having a directed [focused] quality, and to the maximum extent reducing the enemy’s
degree of damage {huishang chengdu} to our information systems, to ensure our military’s operational INFOSEC and the
stable operation {yunxing} of our information systems. [end of page 63] Within future wars, a powerful enemy will rely
on information superiority, and by various means conduct full-dimensional {quanfangwei} electronic reconnaissance and
high-intensity electronic attacks against our command information system. Only by adopting rigorous information
protection and eliminating the direct threats to the composition of our information system can [we] effectively protect
the security of battlefield information systems.

In implementing the principle of rigorous protection to ensure security, first is that the joint campaign commander
[JCC] {lianhe zhanyi zhihuiyuan} and his command organ $\{ zhi hui jig uan \}$ should set out from the overall situation
of the campaign, unify the organization and operations-research-based planning of information protection activities, lay
stress on the protection key points, and strengthen the protection for important targets such as the vital site
positions and critical nodes within the command information system, to ensure the security of battlefield information
and information systems. Second, based on the characteristics of the enemy information offense, combined with the
battlefield reality, is adoption of information protection measures in an all-around, key point manner, having a
directed [focused] quality, to ensure that our side effectively acquires, transmits, processes, and exploits operational
information. [This means] boosting the information system’s counter-reconnaissance {fanzhencha}, counter-jamming
{fanganrao}, counter-stealth {fanyinshen}, and counter-destruction {fancuihui} capabilities. Third is synthetically
applying multiple information offense means to assistsupport and complement $\{ zhi yua npe ihe \}$ the protection of
important targets. Fourth is implementing an INFOSEC secrecy system {xinxi anquan baomi zhidu}, strictly adhering to the
various specifications $\{ gui din g \}$ , and guarding against the leak of important IO secrets and EM information
leakage {dianci xinxi xielou}. Fifth is strengthening self-protection {zishen fanghu} for the IO professional strengths,
to boost battlefield survivability.

# III. Several issues which should be given attention when implementing and applying the basic principles of IO…64

The basic principles of joint campaign IO have reflected the basic laws of joint campaign IO, and possess a fairly
strong directed [focused] quality and guidance quality. However, within future joint campaign activities, due to the
differences in campaign patterns {zhanyi yangshi}, the differences in the battlefield environment, and the differences
in the objects of operations $\{ zuo zha n ~ dui xia n g \}$ , and in particular following on the constant development
of IT, both the modes and the methods of IO may undergo fairly great changes. Hence, within joint campaign IO
activities, [the JCC and his command organ] must, based on the specific {juti} situation, overall grasp and flexibly
apply the above principles, and must not apply them mechanically or indiscriminately { 生搬硬套 shengban yingtao}. At the
same time, they also must, via large amounts of training or real combat testing {shizhan jianyan}, constantly summarize
and develop new operational principles. [end of page 64]

(1) Overall grasp

Joint campaign IO is an operational SoS which involves a broad scope and complex relationships. Within the operational
process, [the JCC and command organ] not only must adjust-coordinate the relationships among the various IO forms {形式
xingshi}, including EW, network warfare [CNW], and PSYWAR, but also must keep an eye on the relationship between IO and
the joint campaign’s other operational activities; they not only must actively implement information offense, but also
must attach high importance to their own information protection; and they not only must fully grasp the attack and
defense activities {gongfang xingdong} for soft-kill information weapons, but also must pay attention to information
attack and defense activities for hard-kill weapons. The JCC and his command institution, when organizing
operations-research-based planning of IO, should from the overall viewpoint grasp the key points in IO strength employment and in information
offense and defense, in the adjusted-coordinated application of soft-kill means and hard-kill means, and in stratagem
guidance {moulue zhidao} for information weapons technology and IO; focus on the overall situation; take all things into
consideration; make overall use of mathematical and scientific methods {zongti yunchou}; and guard against attending to
one thing while losing sight of the other.

# (2) Flexible application

The basic principles of joint campaign IO are the basic criteria guiding the joint campaign IO activities, and have a
universal quality {pubianxiang}. Due to the differences in joint campaign patterns, the differences in the objects of
operations, and the differences in the operational environment, joint campaign IO under different conditions thus will
have individual different characteristics. This then requires that we organically combine the basic, universal-quality
IO principles together with the specific situation, and, based on the different joint campaign IO situations, flexibly
apply these guidance principles well. In addition, [we] also must combine them with the specific situation of the
campaign and thus carry out detailing $\{ xih u a \}$ of these basic principles, to enhance their operability $\{ cao
zuo xin g \}$ , so that every IO activity can obtain scientific and effective guidance. In the different phases carried
out in a campaign, the key points of IO will differ, and will require timely adjustment of the guiding principles.

# (3) Innovating development

Joint campaign IO is a new topic $\{ ket i \}$ facing our military within the process of realizing the dual historic
mission of mechanization and informatization. In recent years, although all levels of our military’s senior officers $\{
sho uzh ang \}$ , [end of page 65] organs, and units all have attached unusual importance to study of [research on] this
topic, nonetheless, due to the restrictions on IT levels and the lack of corresponding experience in practice, studies
of the laws and characteristics of joint campaign IO still are insufficiently deep and all-around. These inadequacies
are reflected in studies of the IO principles, and it should be said that there are still a good many fields not
understood or not understood clearly. The above five basic principles still are only an initial research achievement,
and still await further testing and perfection within future training and operational practice. From the viewpoints of
the development of IT within the world scope and of the trend of its application in the military field, the progress
{jincheng} of military informatization is still far from being completed, while IT is still being constantly developed
and perfected, and, in mutual adaptation to this, new IO patterns also are constantly emerging. Hence, studies of the
basic principles of joint campaign IO likewise may constantly be adjusted following on the development of the times and
of technology. [We] must keep our eyes on development, and keenly acquire insight into and forecast $\{ yuc e \}$ the
influence of the developing changes in the information field on information operations, uphold liberation thought, and
constantly innovate and develop information operations basic principles adapted to our military’s actual situation. Only
in this manner can [we] adapt to the development of the times, seize the initiative within the worldwide tide of
informationized military revolution [i.e., Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)], and within future military struggle be
in an invincible position {liyu bubai zhidi}. [end of page 66; end of chapter]

# Chapter 4 Joint Campaign Information Operations Strengths {liliang}…67

Joint campaign information operations (IO) strengths signify the general term for the various types of strengths
participating in joint campaign IO, under a unified intention and guidance {tongyi qitu he zhidao}. They are an
important component {zucheng bufen} of joint campaign operational strengths.

# Section 1: Characteristics {tedian} of Joint Campaign IO Strengths…67

The practice of several recent local wars has proven that joint campaign operations − no matter whether in terms of
external features {tezheng} or essential connotations {本质内涵 benzhi neihan} − always have undergone profound changes.
Most prominent is that the information essential factors $\{ xin xiy aos u \}$ already have become the basic essential
factors in armed forces combat power {jundui zhandouli}, and joint campaign IO strengths also have already become
important support {zhicheng} for the joint campaign strengths.

# I. Infiltration {shentou} into many fields {lingyu}, involvement of many levels {cengci}, and possession of a high degree of wide-zone quality {guangyuxing}…6

Following on the development of information technology [IT] {xinxi jishu} and its wide application in the military, the
battlefield environment is undergoing hitherto unknown changes, and the operations field no longer is limited to the
traditional battlespace {zhanchang kongjian}. The trends toward weapons and equipment informatization {wuqi zhuangbei
xinxihua} and information equipment weaponization {xinxi zhuangbei wuqihua}, and their interdynamic development {hudong
fazhan}, mutual fusion $\{ hux ian gro ngh e \}$ , and mutual infiltration $\{ hux ian gsh ent o u \}$ have caused the
extension $\{ wai yan \}$ and connotations of joint campaign IO strengths to attain maximum expansion. Joint campaign IO
strengths already have infiltrated into the midst of all operational activities $\{ zuo zha nxi ngd ong \}$ . First is
their infiltration into various fields, including the military, political, science and technology [S&T] $\{ kej i \}$ ,
[end of page 67] economic, and security {anquan} [fields]. IO has a very strong political quality and strategic quality
$\{ zha nlu exi n g \}$ ; the military activity $\{ huo don g \}$ of the engaging sides {jiaozhan shuangfang} can upward
connect $\{ sha ngl ian \}$ to heads of state and state organs $\{ guo jia sho una oji gua n \}$ , and reach down to the
common masses. For example, intrusions $\{ qin r u \}$ , attacks $\{ gon gji \}$ , and sabotage $\{ poh uai \}$ against
important information networks not only can come from military function institutions {junshi zhineng jigou}, but also
can come from nongovernmental computer hackers {minjian heike}. Second is their infiltration into all levels: strategic,
campaign, and tactical. Information activity has broken through the traditional battlefield demarcation lines; the
operational level is not clearly demarcated {jieding}, and there even could arise a tendency [for the levels] to
coincide {chonghe}. For the side which holds information superiority $\{ xin xiy ous h i \}$ , the battlefield’s
unidirectional transparency {danxiang toumingdu $\}$ will be high. That side will have the capability to simultaneously execute strikes against the
battlefield’s full depth {quan zongshen}, including strategic, campaign, and tactical objectives {mubiao};
beyond-time-and-space {chaoshikong} command and control [C2] {zhihui kongzhi} capability; and long-range precision
strike {yuancheng jingque daji} capability. These enable tactical strikes to directly achieve campaign and even war
goals {zhanzheng mudi}, and command networks with IT as their support {zhicheng} enable strategic command $\{ zha nlu e
\ zhi hui \}$ at any time to intervene at the tactical level. In future operations, the characteristics of
strategic-level decisionmaking {zhanlueji juece}, campaign-level command, and tactical-level activities will be even
more prominent. Third is their infiltration into all systems $\{ xit ong \}$ of weapons and equipment. IO strengths have
a very strong dependent quality {yifuxing} and fused quality {ronghexing}; many cannot separately bring into play a role
{zuoyong} independent of the other operational strengths, but must be mutually combined with the other strengths, and
interact {xianghu zuoyong} with them, to jointly produce operational effectiveness $\{ zuo zha nxi aon eng \}$ . At the
same time, weapons and equipment systems also are becoming more informationized day by day.

# II. Compositional essential factors are complex, and momentum disposition is decentralized {bushi fensan}; possession of a distinct multidimensional quality {duoyuanxing}…68

Joint campaign IO strengths in terms of composition possess a multidimensional quality. They not only include
professional {zhuanye} IO strengths, but also include nonprofessional IO strengths; they not only include sea and land
IO strengths, but also include air and outer space {kongzhong, taikong} IO strengths; they not only include conventional
$\{ cha ngg u i \}$ IO strengths, but also include unconventional IO strengths; and they not only include material $\{
wuz h i \}$ IO strengths to strike at and sabotage enemy weapons and equipment, but also include IO strengths to attack
the enemy’s consciousness and thought {yishi, sixiang}. The IO strength distribution is extremely wide-ranging. First is
the dispersal of professional IO strengths over the entire battlespace. Professional IO strengths involved in many
aspects, such as electronic warfare [EW] {dianzizhan}, network warfare $\{ wan glu ozh a n \}$ , and psychological
warfare [PSYWAR] $\{ xin liz han \}$ , are interwoven together with other operational strengths, [end of page 68] and
will be jointly active with them over the entire battlefield of the future. Second is the wide participation of the
nonprofessional IO strengths. Against those targets where application of means such as high-tech intelligence warfare
{qingbaozhan}, network warfare, and EW has difficulty proving effective, [we] can apply the method of a mutual
combination of nonprofessional IO strengths with means such as traditional reconnaissance $\{ zhe nch a \}$ , special
operations $\{ tez hon gzu ozh a n \}$ , firepower attack, and activities deception {xingdong qipian}, and can [thus]
completely destroy or sabotage the enemy information systems. Third is the joint integration $\{ lia nhe yit i \}$ of
peacetime and wartime military-civilian {pingzhanshi junmin} IO strengths. IO is boundless and borderless $\{ wuj ian
gwu jie \}$ , intangible and formless $\{ wux ing wux ian g \}$ , and present at all times $\{ wus hib uza i \}$ ; and
the peacetime-wartime demarcation line tends to blur, so that peacetime and wartime information strengths are present
all along.

# III. Task organization {biancheng} and employment integration requirements {shiyong yitihua yaoqiu} are stringent; possession of a complex systematic quality {xitongxing}…69

Under the effect of system integration $\{ xit ong jic hen g \}$ , the various essential factors of joint campaign IO
strengths constitute an organic integrated whole {youji zhengti}, to conduct system confrontation $\{ xit ong dui kan g
\}$ and system-of-systems [SoS] warfare {tixi duikang}. First of all, the integrity {wanzhengxing} of the information
flow path requires that the four links {huanjie}, information acquisition, processing, transmission, and exploitation
{xinxi huoqu, chuli, chuanshu, liyong}, must constitute an organic whole $\{ yit i \}$ , and cannot be broken apart $\{
fen ^ { \prime } g e \}$ . The various parts are both mutually independent {xianghu duli} and mutually conditional
{huwei tiaojian}, mutually correlated $\{ xia ngh u \ gua nli a n \}$ and mutually restrictive {xianghu zhiyue}. Next,
information systems and main battle weapons and equipment are joined into an organic whole {yiti lianjie}, to bring into
play their might $\{ wei l i \}$ . Operations no longer are single confrontations of weapons and equipment, but rather
are system confrontations composed of various strengths, ground, sea, air, and outer space, under the joining of
information systems. Third, the IO strengths [form a] system synthesis {xitong hecheng}, with interconnection,
intercommunication, and interoperability {hulian, hutong, hucaozuo}; the entire information battlefield is joined into
an organic whole. This causes operational activities to be adjusted-coordinated $\{ xie tia o \}$ consistently, and
joins all spaces, land, sea, air, space, and electromagnetic [EM] {lu, hai, kong, tian, dian}, into one enormous
full-dimensional IO network {quanwei xinxi zuozhan wangluo}.

# Section 2: Classification {fenlei} and Task Organization of Joint Campaign IO Strengths…69

The joint campaign IO strengths are an important material basis for carrying out joint campaign IO. Correctly
recognizing the types {leixing} of joint campaign IO strengths and their composition [end of page 69] has important
significance for achieving the joint campaign IO goals.

# I. Classification of joint campaign IO strengths…70

The classification of joint campaign IO strengths can be differentiated from different standpoints. From the standpoint
of service and arm structure {junbingzhong $jie gou \}$ , they can be differentiated into Army, Navy, Air Force, and
Second Artillery Corps IO strengths for joint campaign IO, and armed police unit {wuzhuang jingcha budui} and local
{difang} IO strengths. From the standpoint of mission nature and functional structure $\{ zhi nen gji ego u \}$ , they
can be differentiated into IO command strengths, IO attack and defense strengths $\{ gon gfa ngl ili ang \}$ , and IO
support strengths {baozhang liliang}.8 From the standpoint of damage form {huishang xingshi}, they can be differentiated
into IO “soft strike” {“ruan daji”} and “hard destruction” {“ying cuihui”} strengths. From the standpoint of
professional type, they can be differentiated into professional IO strengths and nonprofessional IO strengths. The basic
classification of joint campaign IO strengths mainly includes the following two types:

(1) “Soft strike” and “hard destruction” IO strengths

“Soft strike” strengths mainly include four types: the first is electronic jamming {dianzi ganrao} strengths, such as
radar jamming {leida ganrao}, communication jamming $\{ ton gxi nga nra o \}$ , electro-optical [E-O] jamming {guangdian
ganrao}, and hydroacoustic jamming $\{ shu ish eng gan rao \}$ . The second type is computer network attack {jisuanji
wangluo gongji} strengths, such as for computer virus attack {jisuanji bingdu gongji} and computer hacker infiltration
{heike shentou}. The third type is psychological attack $\{ xin lig ong i i \}$ strengths, such as for psychological
attacks carried out by methods like TV, radio, printed matter, and virtual reality [VR] {xuni xianshi} technology. The
fourth type is intelligence warfare strengths, such as for deliberately transmitting false intelligence {weijia qingbao}
to enemy intelligence systems and for acquiring intelligence from the enemy.

The “hard destruction” strengths mainly include the following: first are the precision and conventional fire strike
strengths; second are anti-radiation attack {fanfushe $gon gji \}$ strengths; third are special information warfare [IW]
weapons {teshu xinxizhan wuqi} (laser {jiguang}, high-power microwave [HPM] {gaoneng weibo}, particle beam $\{ liz ish u
\}$ , EM pulse {dianci maichong}, and carbon fiber weapons {tan xianweisi wuqi}); and fourth are non-lethal [quality]
weapons {feizhimingxing wuqi}.

(2) Professional and nonprofessional IO strengths

# 1. Professional IO strengths

Professional IO strengths signify the strengths specially used for conducting IO. [end of page 70] They are the
mainstays of joint campaign IO, and have a task organization of IO professional strengths sent by higher levels as
reinforcements {jiaqiang}, plus those within the root-level organizational system {benji jianzhi}. They usually include
the following: joint campaign directly subordinate IO strengths, with a task organization of IO units (elements) $\{ b u
\ ( fen ) \ dui \}$ directly commanded by the joint campaign command institution $\{ zhi hui jig o u \}$ ; Army IO
strengths, with a task organization of the Army’s various group army {jituanjun} IO units (elements); Navy IO strengths,

# 2. Nonprofessional IO strengths

The nonprofessional IO strengths, relative to the professional IO strengths, mainly indicate other operational strengths
which are outside the IO task organization, and used for assisting-supporting {zhiyuan} and complementing {peihe} the
professional IO strengths and for fulfilling IO missions. The nonprofessional IO strengths, such as the fire strike
strengths and the local support-the-front strengths {difang zhiqian liliang} for assisting support to IO, are an
important component of the joint campaign IO strengths. Under the current circumstances where our military’s IO
professional strengths are fairly limited, we should fully bring into play the role of nonprofessional IO strengths, to
enhance IO capability.

Special operations sabotage-raid $\{ pox i \}$ information system strengths signify, within implementation of IO,
operational strengths which apply the special operations forces {tezhong zuozhan budui} (groupings $\left\{ qun \right\}
.$ ) of all campaign-participating services and arms to sabotage the enemy information systems. They mainly include the
following: special reconnaissance {tezhong zhencha} and strike units (elements), as well as units (elements) which can
execute special IO missions.

# Section 4: Organizational Grouping {bianzu} of Joint Campaign IO Strengths…76

The organizational grouping of joint campaign IO strengths usually has an organizational grouping form flexibly
{linghuo} determined in the campaign preparations phase by the IO commander {xinxi zuozhan zhihuiyuan}, based on
situations such as the general campaign intent $\{ zon gde zha nyi yit u \}$ , IO intention, battlefield IO posture
{taishi}, and our military’s campaign IO strength composition. [end of page 76] It must accomplish mutual adaptation to
the campaign scale and campaign pattern, mutual adaptation to the IO missions undertaken by the units, mutual adaptation
to the IO capability of the units, mutual adaptation to the campaign organizational grouping requirements, and mutual
adaptation to the battlefield environment. From the viewpoint of the needs and requirements of the joint campaign
patterns and IO activities which our military can implement in the future, usually there will be two organizational
grouping forms. The first is organizational grouping per service and arm {an junbingzhong bianzu}, while the second is
organizational grouping per operational group {an zuozhan jituan bianzu}.

# I. Organizational grouping per service and arm…77

IO is an important activity within joint campaigns. Under the usual circumstances, it is composed of a series of
interrelated {相互联系 xianghu lianxi} ground, air, and sea IO activities. This objective situation requires us from a
macroscopic {hongguan} standpoint to carry out unified organizational grouping of the IO strengths within joint
campaigns, i.e., to perform organization grouping of IO strengths per service and arm.

operational activities of the root service and arm.

# II. Organizational grouping per operational group…79

In order to even better carry out scientific combination of the joint campaign IO strengths, seeing that all strength
essential factors bring into play the optimal superiority $\{ zui jia you shi \}$ will boost integrated-whole
operational capability {zhengti zuozhan nengli}. The joint campaign IO-strength task organization form, often based on
the specific campaign’s nature and missions, has an organizational grouping of a number of interrelated operational
group IO groupings {zuozhan jituan xinxi zuozhan qun}. Under the usual circumstances, they can be organizationally
grouped into joint campaign directly subordinate IO groups (groupings) {jituan (qun)}, Army operational group IO
groupings, Air Force operational group IO groupings, naval operational group IO groupings, missile strike group {daodan
tuji jituan} IO groupings, and special operations group IO groupings. The organizational grouping into the above various
group IO groupings is one which sets out from the general situation of the joint campaign IO strengths to carry out a
conception [vision] {shexiang} and give it consideration. During the actual organizational grouping, it is uncertain {bu
yiding} that every campaign’s IO must organizationally group this many group IO groupings; it could be less than, but
also could exceed this scope, and is flexibly determined based on the specific situation of campaign IO.

(1) Joint campaign directly subordinate IO groups (groupings)

The joint campaign directly subordinate IO groups (groupings) usually have a main task organization of General HQ
attached and [end of page 79] theater directly subordinate IO units, as well as some information offense units of the

# Chapter 5 Targets of Joint Campaign Information Operations…82

Targets of joint campaign information operations are the targets for attack in information operation activities.
Determination of the targets of information operations is one of the important substances of information operations
decisions made by joint campaign information operation commanders and their command organizations and it is an important
basis for the commander’s scientific decision and effective plan. Accurate selection and attack of targets in
information operations are prerequisite for seizing partial control of information power in a joint campaign.

# Section 1: Principle in Selection of the Targets of Joint Campaign Information Operations…82

The selection of the targets of joint campaign information operations should handle the following points in addition to
adhering to the general principles in selection of operation targets.

# I. Concentrate on the overall situation and hold on to the key point…82

One must unitarily take on the overall situation of the operation and select the key targets that are favorable to
achieving operational intent and speeding up the operational process when selecting the targets in information
operations. Through the attack of information operations targets, it will create a domino operational effect, break down
the enemy’s entire structure, and maximally weaken the enemy’s overall operational capability. Correct selection of
targets can guarantee accuracy in information attack and benefit speedy achievement of the operation goal.

In selection of information operations targets, it must first, obey the requirement of servicing the overall situation
of the joint campaign operation. The policy requirement must be closely surrounding the campaign intent, focusing on the
overall situation of the campaign, and having a handle of the selection of the targets. It must plan the information
operations activities starting from the overall situation and determine information operations attack key point in order
to really express the overall power of the joint campaign operation. Second, it must be favorable to speeding up the
operation process. It should select and attack the vital point in the enemy’s operation information system, use this
vital point to defeat and collapse the enemy’s overall situation, and achieve the goal of prompt military decision. For
example, one can effectively take away the enemy’s operation measure, speed up the operation process, shorten campaign
continued time, and quickly achieve the goal of the campaign or war by attacking the key parts of the enemy’s command
and control system and damaging the enemy’s perception and judgment capability on the battlefield situation.

# II. Stand by one’s own capability to precisely select targets…83

When selecting information operations targets, we must base it on the objective reality that our military information
operation measure is relatively insufficient and we must depend on our information operations reconnaissance and
information attack capability to precisely select the category, quantity, and scale of the information attack target and
use the lowest cost, highest efficiency, and maximum limit to damage the enemy’s information and information system
effectiveness and achieve the operation goal.

In selection of information operations targets, it must first, have a handle on our military information operation
capability. Starting from the overall weapon and equipment capability for our military to participate in war, we should
comprehensively analyze the sustained time of information attack and operation space and possible result and accurately
handle the relationship between necessary and possibility. Second, it should have a handle on the enemy’s information
operation capability. We should comprehensively understand the category, quantity, function and deployment, military
strength, echelon, command system, and operation deployment of the enemy’s information operation system and equipment,
as well as their operational capability and investable combat forces. Third, it should stand by the idea of defeating
the superior with the inferior. Starting out from the actual situation that our military specialized information
operation power is relatively weaker, we should stand by our inferior information attack weapons and equipment to strike
the enemy’s information system; utilize various measures to carry out all-direction, multi-dimension information attack
against the enemy; form a comprehensive superiority by cleverly combining soft strike and hard destroy, physical attack
and psychological attack; and damage the enemy’s information and information system effectiveness with the lowest cost,
highest efficiency, and maximum limit to achieve operational goal.

# III. Comprehensive analysis and optimum selection of the targets…84

When selecting information operations targets, we should carry out observation and study of multi methods, multi levels,
and multi angles; have a handle on the essence in target selection and contradiction in different levels; and optimize
the selection of the best attack targets to seek the best effectiveness in target attack.

In selection of information operations targets, it is first, a combination of qualitative analysis and quantitative
analysis. Qualitative analysis is to determine the effect caused by carrying out information attack on a target.
Quantitative analysis is to provide the basis and material for qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis result of
information operation target selection must still, at the end, be expressed by qualitative analysis. Therefore, it
should use qualitative analysis as the main thing to achieve the perfect unification of qualitative analysis and
quantitative analysis and raise the scientific nature of information operations target selection. Second, it is the
combination of macroanalysis and micro-analysis. Macro-analysis is to fully consider the inner connection and
transformation among all factors that affect the overall situation in the operation and seek the vital target that has
decisive effect on the overall situation as the attack object. At the same time, we should also carry out micro-analysis
on the target system to find the vital part and attack point and thus, achieve the “domino” effect of “striking one
point to break down the entire situation” through information attack of the “vital part.” Third, it is a combination of
static analysis and dynamic analysis. Static analysis can have a handle of the basic information of a target, understand
the general condition of a target to get the general conclusion in peacetime conditions, and provide reference for
target selection in wartime. The conclusion of static analysis often cannot keep up with the changes in operation
rhythm, so, to a very large degree, it must depend on increasing the dynamic analysis capability to be the answer. Based
on the changes of operation task, operation action, operation stage, and operation opportunity, it analyzes the possible
development of the relevant factors in information operations target selection, seeks the relatively certain factors
under the uncertain environment, and increases the accuracy and timeliness of information operations target selection.

# IV. Alteration due to situational changes to flexibly select targets…85

When selecting information operation targets, we should base it on the changes in the objective situation, focus on the
nature and operational state of the attack targets, and flexibly select targets based on the different situations and
activities that appear during the process of attacking the enemy’s targets to timely adjust the attack targets, so the
target selection is suitable with the activity characteristic and concrete situation of the targets.

In selection of information operations targets, one should first, closely pay attention to the changes in the enemy’s
situation. One should timely keep track of the development and change in the enemy situation when selecting targets in
information operations, that is to pay attention to changes in operation targets, situational changes of the enemy
targets, attack result of the targets, and overall changes of the enemy situation to achieve anticipation of the enemy
first and advanced preparation. Second, one should have an overall handle of the changes in our own situation. One
should flexibly ascertain the scope of information operations targets and rationally determine the category and quantity
of information operations targets according to the changes in operational tasks and operational capability. One should
analyze the situation in completion of tasks that are relevant to friendly troops and the existing issues in operation
coordination, and also foresee the difficulty that may occur in order to make information operations target selection be
coordinated with the relevant friendly situation. Third, one should take the initiative to adapt to the changes in the
battlefield environment. One should accurately have a handle on the characteristic and pattern of the battlefield
information environment, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and have a handle of the development trend through
investigation and study of the battlefield information environment and then actively adapt to and use the changes in the
battlefield environment to increase our military’s adaptability to the battlefield environment.

# Section 2: The Basis for Joint Campaign Information Operation Target Selection…85

Under the general situation, joint campaign information operations target selection should consider factors such as
information operation intent, information operations power, target intelligence, target value, battlefield information
environment, and operation timeline.

# I. Operation intent…86

Joint campaign information operation intent is the basis for information operations activities that have reflected the
most basic intention and concept for the commander to complete the information operations tasks and also is the
fundamental basis for information operations target selection.

Operation intent determines the general attack target, not only it relates to the entirety and accuracy in information
operations target selection, but also the result of the operation; therefore, selection of information operations
targets must be carried out by closely revolving around the operational intention from the higher up. One must clearly
be assured of the concrete operational purpose and responsibility in each stage and each time of the campaign and be
certain of the information operations targets in each stage and each time of the campaign. During the Gulf War, Kosovo
War, and Afghanistan War, in order to reach the goal of paralyzing the enemy’s operational system, the US military
always made the enemy’s command and control center and communication and reconnaissance early warning system the “key
points” of its strike when selecting striking targets and making the enemy’s operational system to become paralyzed so
that it was able to control the battlefield situation, lead the combat development, and lay down a solid foundation for
the final victory in war.

# II. Operation power…86

Operation power generally indicates the total of factors such as personnel carrying out the operation and weapons and
equipment and it is the main body for pursuing operations and material basis for all activities in the battlefield. All
expected results of operation target selection in the battlefield must be realized through the implementation of
operation power.

Operation power is the material basis in target selection. High-tech weapons and equipment that use information and
information technology as the core have become an important symbol to measure the strength or weakness of operation
power and have become the objective factor in restricting target selection and also drawing effect on target selection.
The strength or weakness of operation power directly relate to the ability to attack a target, attack what target, and
achieve what kind of result, and it is an important basis and prerequisite to information operations target selection.
For example, if the power is clearly stronger than the enemy military, then one can willfully select attack targets based on operation intent; on the other hand, if the power is not sufficient, then one can only select
some targets that are less difficult and suitable for one’s capability. It is only when operation power is transformed
into actual operational capability that it can be fully effective in operation and this transformation involves many
objective factors. During operations, accurate operation direction combined with favorable battlefield space and time
factor could make the party with weaker operation power to gain initiative and finally defeat the strong one and these
types of example in the past were many. Therefore, we generally should comprehensively consider these factors when
carrying out target selection from the angle of operation power.

# III. Target intelligence…87

Accurate selection of information operations targets must rely on first hand target intelligence and then carry out
accurate analysis and judgment and have a control of the battlefield situation and the enemy’s activity pattern to
correctly select operation targets and make correct operation determination.

Target intelligence under informatory conditions has become the prerequisite of information operations target selection.
Accurate analysis and utilization of a large amount of target information can provide support to drawing up information
operation target decision plan. Six months prior to the Gulf War, with advanced reconnaissance technology and after a
long period of thorough and detailed information operations reconnaissance, the multi-nation troops knew the target
intelligence such as operational system, frequency, and position of almost all electronic facilities in the radio
stations, radar, guided navigational facilities and missile guidance systems of the Iraqi military as the palm of their
hands and made good preparation for a scientifically implemented target decisions and the first round precision strike
and information attacks after the war started.

Information operations target intelligence must be able to reflect the truth of target and accurate situation and
provide accurate data and objective judgment. More accurate target intelligence will make the target selection more
precise; while incorrect even wrong intelligence would lead information operations target selection onto a wrong path.
The target category that target intelligence is involved in must fulfill the intelligence requirements of target
selection and it is without any meaning to provide some target intelligences that are outside the scope of information
operations target selection. Under informatory condition, the battlefield situation changes swiftly and operation
targets are in fierce dynamic changes, so target intelligence must reflect the target condition in real time in order
for target selection to follow the development and change in battlefield rhythm and battlefield situation. The higher
the value of target intelligence is, the better the quality of target selection becomes.

# IV. Target value…88

Target value indicates the effect and position of a target on a specific battlefield and is a sort of comprehensive
index used to describe the necessity to adopt information operations attack activities against battlefield targets under
a specific condition, and it also indicates a certain fulfillment of targets in the requirement of information
operations. The source of value comes from targets and targets provide value, and the target value in information
operations target selection should be as mutually consistent with actual value as possible.

The fundamental standard of information operations target selection is target value and the core issues to be resolved
are mainly two and they are the issues of “do we want to do it {要不要 yao bu yao}” and “can we do it {能不能 neng bun eng}.”
The first one is the issue of wanting to resolve the necessity of target attack, while the other one is the issue of
resolving the feasibility of target attack.

The magnitude of target value is an important content of target selection and is a certain fulfillment for operation
requirements. Information operations target selection is to assess target value and further determine the precedence of
attack through establishing a certain standard. Since information operations targets change frequently and are in
various forms, furthermore, the factors that affect target value are many; so, how to measure target value with relative
scientific and integrated standards has become the key issue urgently waiting to be resolved in information operations
target selection. Currently, the indices for measuring target value are mainly: target’s importance, which is the
position and effectiveness of target in the entire operation system; target’s threat, which is the degree of obstruction
to our operation activities and level of threat to our security from the target; and target’s strike effectiveness,
which is the degree in destroyable and recovery of the target. On this basis, it is important to determine index value
and index power and finally combine calculate the index value to form a target value rank.

# V. Battlefield information environment…89

The battlefield information environment is the general term for various situation and condition in informatory
battlefield and its surrounding that affect information operations activities. It is the basis for organizing and
carrying out information operations and an important factor for restraining information operations activities. Each
category of target in information operations is located in the battlefield information environment and cannot avoid both
active and passive influences from the battlefield information environment. Accurate and appropriate amount of
information in the battlefield information environment can help the analysis of information operations targets, rational
selection and determination of information operations targets, and making close to realtime reaction on the selected
targets. Inaccurate and excessive amount of information in the battlefield information environment is not favorable to
overall analysis and accurate handling of the situation on the targets and making a scientific decision on the targets.

Under informatized conditions, the operation rhythm quickens; the battlefield situation changes frequently; the
undetermined factor increases; the amount of battlefield information increases greatly; the difficulty of handling
information increases; all links such as collection, transmission, handling, and utilization of information will be
affected in different degrees; and a tiny error in any one link may lead to serious slip ups. When selecting information
operations targets, one should use obtaining a large amount of accurate and timely information as the basis and also
speed up the selection rhythm to meet the changes of the battlefield situation, so there is great challenge in the time
effectiveness and accuracy of target selection. How to overall understand the battlefield situation and further
coordinate information operations target selection with the battlefield reality are the key issues that joint campaign
information operations target selection must resolve.

# VI. Operation timeline…89

The operation timeline is the reflection of operation activity continuity and also the format of operation activity
existence. Any operation activity must proceed in a specific of time and when selecting information operations targets,
anyone who wins the time wins the initiative. During information operations target selection, it would have important
meaning on increasing the result of target selection and attack if one fully utilized one’s own usable time to make a
decision and act before the enemy. The US military focused on time effectiveness when carrying out joint target
selection and strike by emphasizing “targets that are time sensitive” that is “those targets that cause (or will soon
cause) danger to one’s own troops and must be taken care of immediately, or those temporary targets that are worthy and
will soon disappear,” and stipulated in detail the items that should be considered on targets that are time sensitive.
On the informatized battlefield, the operation action, force deployment, and operation target of the opposing parties
are in dynamic changes, so information operations target selection must keep up with the fast rhythm demand of the war,
be good in taking advantage of war opportunity, and distinguish the enemy’s movement with sharp observation to discover
and catch the smallest unusual phenomenon and sign, predict the situation development and change, timely change the
attack targets, and achieve the goal of changing as the enemy, changing prior to the enemy, and controlling changes with
fast action. We should quickly identify and attack those technical jamming targets such as maneuvering, camouflage,
concealment, and deceiving before the enemy is able to use them, so we can achieve the expected result.

# Section 3: Categorization of Information Operations Targets…90

Information operations target category is the partition applied to the types of information operation targets. To
scientifically categorize the information operations targets is the prerequisite and foundation for studying information
operations target selection in depth and also the objective requirement for closely combining the theory and practice of
information operations target selection. Based on different standards, we can categorize information operations targets
from different sides.

# I. Categorization based on space and location of targets…90

According to the space and location of the targets, we can divide information operations targets into ground targets,
water (above and below) targets, and air (space) targets.

Ground targets mainly indicate the targets that use land as the space of their operation activity such as ground radar
stations, ground microwave relays communication hubs, ground command information systems as well as other vehicular and
stationary information systems and facilities. Land space is the first dimensional space for military activity and it is
the starting point and ending point of the other spaces activities; therefore, land targets constitute the main entity
of operation targets. Following the fast development in science and technology, the operation space is constantly
expanding and the position of water targets and air targets are also becoming more profound in modern war. Water targets
and air (space) targets are the second dimension and third dimension respectively and space targets have been gradually
developing after new operation measures such as naval vessels and airplanes (satellites) appeared and are used in large
quantity in wars. Water (above and below) targets include mainly all types of vessel carrier information systems and
facilities and air (space) target includes mainly all types of airplane carrier (satellite carrier) information systems
and facilities.

# II. Categorization based on attack measure…91

The attack measures of information operations mainly include electronic attack, network attack, and psychological
attack. Starting from this angle, one can divide the information operations targets into electronic attack targets,
network attack targets, and psychological attack targets.

Electronic attack mainly includes electronic jamming, counter-radiation weapon attack, and special information warfare
weapon attack and it emphasizes more on the weakening and damaging of information collection and transmission links and
the targets are mainly all types of electronic information systems such as early warning detection systems, command and
control systems, and communications systems. Network attack mainly includes information stoppage, network infiltration,
and virus attack and they mainly damage the enemy’s information management through searching of network’s “loophole” and
“backdoor” and the target is mainly network type information systems. Psychological attack mainly includes psychological
propaganda, psychological deception, and psychological threat.

# III. Categorization based on the importance of target…92

In this categorization, information operations targets can be divided into core targets, key targets, and general
targets. A core target is the enemy’s target that has important meaning and with major supporting effectiveness such as
the enemy’s command and control system. The number of core targets is limited but with great value and once attacked,
they may cause the enemy’s information to be paralyzed and the operation system to collapse. A key target is an enemy’s
target with important effect and rather great influence. A general target is a target with general effect and least
influence. It is necessary to point out that core targets, key targets, and general targets are often relative and
conditional and under a specific situation, they can mutually transform.

# IV. Categorization based on targets attack sequence…92

Based on targets attack sequence, it can be divided into primary attack target, follow-up attack target, and sustained
attack target. A primary attack target is a target that should be attacked first based on operation requirement and
generally is a target with strong time effectiveness or great effect and the highest importance in follow-up operation
activities. A follow-up attack target is an attack target that is relatively behind in time sequence, relatively
speaking, comparing with a primary attack target and generally is the second and third batch target. A sustained attack
target is a target that requires close attention and is always maintained in attack condition during all process or most
of the time in information operations such as the enemy’s command information system.

# V. Categorization based on the composition of target…92

Information operations is an action adopted to weaken and damage the enemy’s information and information system, and at
the same time, protect one’s own information and information system, so an information operation target mainly is
composed of information and an information system; therefore, we can divide the targets into information and information
system based on composition of the target.

An information system is the general term for a system especially used to collect, store, handle, transmit, manage, and
utilize information. An information system has many categories and they are the strategic information system, campaign
information system, and tactical information system if divided based on their level and scope of utilization, and
intelligence reconnaissance system, early warning detection system, command and control system, communications system,
and information operation system if based on their function and usage.

# Section 4: Joint Campaign Information Operation Target Selection Procedure…93

The general procedure of joint campaign information operations target selection: accumulation of target information,
analysis and edition of intelligence; learn the operation intention, understand the information operations task; collect
battlefield intelligence, identify target information; analyze target characteristics, predict target inventory;
determine target inventory, propose decision-making suggestion.

# I. Accumulate target information, analyze and edit intelligence…93

As the first step of information operations target selection, accumulate target information and analysis and edition of
intelligence must be developed around satisfying the requirements for information operations target selection.

First is to collect wide a variety of target information. The wide collection and accumulation of target information are
to collect and be in control of the information operations intelligence information of the advanced nations and
neighboring nations and regions and be in control of their radar, communications, electronic warfare, and network
warfare units, as well as their relevant deployment, authorized strength sequence, tactical technical function, working
patterns and development actions, and operation ideological principles. Second is to collect the focal point of target
information. That is one should analyze the make-up and tactical technical parameters of the major opponent’s
information system in information operations and one must especially focus on checking the enemy’s operation structure,
troop deployment, and major operation method to provide strategic intelligence to one’s own information operations and
comparatively macro intelligence information support to information operations target selection. Third is to analyze and
reorganize target intelligence. That is one should put together the goal of information operations activities with all
the collected target intelligence information and material and carry out synthesis, analysis, assessment, and approval.
One should pay attention to analyze overall and in detail the intelligence information that are collected through all
channels and truthfully come out with the correct analytical conclusion to avoid prejudice and wishful thinking and
result in incorrect judgment.

# II. Learn the operation intention, understand the information operation task…94

Learning the operation intention and understanding the information operations task are to carry out information
operations target selection under the direction and restriction of operation intention and operation requirement.

# (1) Learning the intention of the higher up

When selecting joint campaign information operations targets, learning the intention of the higher up must focus clearly
and accurately on operation goal, operation direction, operation strength, and operation stage. The first one is to
clarify the operation goal. Different operation goals lead to different target selection, for example, if our operation
goal is to conceal surprise defense, then the selected attack targets are definitely the intelligence reconnaissance
system, early warning detection system, and air defense anti-missile system. If our operation goal is strategic threat,
then the attack targets are generally the targets that can create major political influence such as the government
network and the electric power system. The second one is to clarify the operation direction. During operation, the major
operation direction should be favorable to achieving the intention of the higher up, reaching the operation goal,
winning the primary war, and development afterward. The third one is to clarify the operation strength that is how much
operation power to put in and what military forces are deployed in operation to fully display the effectiveness of
different military forces and weaponry in order to show the greatest overall strength of the operation system. The
fourth one is to clarify the operation stage. One can divide the entire operation into several closely connected stages
according to implementation sequences and based on task, striking target, or main operation activities of each military
service. The task, target, and operation activity on each stage are often different.

(2) Understanding the information operations task

One should first be clear of the time, location, deployed unit, adopted method, organized action, action’s target, the
number of the unit’s military force in this action, the weapons and equipment used, the units to be coordinated with,
the task to be completed, and the requirement after the task is completed that the higher up has in mind. One should
focus on the information operations task, connect the order and direction of the higher up to proceed with thinking and
consideration, and accurately hold on to the intention of the higher up and the task of one’s own unit.

# III. Collect battlefield intelligence, identify target information…95

Collecting battlefield intelligence and indentifying target information are to try its best to timely understand and be
in control of the situational changes on the battlefield and identify the target information based on intelligence
accumulation in peacetime, making the information operations target selection to be built on the foundation of true and
objective target information.

(1) Clarifying the necessity for battlefield target intelligence

It is mainly to understand: the technological level; operational structure; special parameter; and tactical function,
deployment, style number, quantity, and working method of current enemy; the organization mechanism of current enemy’s
electronic warfare, network warfare, and psychological warfare as well as the authorized strength sequence, personnel,
and equipment strength of the corresponding units and the quality in training of the units; and the tactical operation
principles, relevant regulations, and the troop utilization situation during operation of the electronic warfare,
network warfare, and psychological warfare units.

(2) Clearing the channels for collecting intelligence information

Clearing the channels for collecting intelligence information should start mainly from the following aspects: first is
to strengthen intelligence information communication with the higher up and that is to accept the higher up’s report on
enemy’s situation and request the higher up for clarifying the relevant situation. Second is to strengthen intelligence
information communication with the intelligence departments. The information operation intelligence departments should
provide a comprehensive enemy’s situation report that includes mainly the enemy’s situation, final conclusion on the
enemy’s situation, and suggestions on events to be checked and the organization of intelligence reconnaissance. Third is
to strengthen intelligence information communication with the subordinates and friendly neighboring nations, that is to
put together the scattered intelligence collected by the subordinates and turn them into intelligence required for
target selection through comprehensive analysis and handling. Fourth is to utilize the relevant intelligence collected
from other channels that is the intelligence through questioning local units, local relevant departments, as well as
reservist, militant, and the public.

# (3) Identifying intelligence information of targets

All-position study of targets’ intelligence, generally, should start from the following aspects: first is to identify
the function of targets, that is, can the attack of this target break down the enemy’s operation system, affect the
campaign overall situation, and directly achieve one’s own operation goal. Second is to identify the target’s structure,
that is, to ascertain the target’s fatal part through studying the hierarchical structure and relevant structure. Third
is to identify the composite distribution of the target that is to mainly clarify the category of the target and its
concrete composition. Fourth is to identify the quantity, degree of threat, and degree of destructibility of the target.

# IV. Analysis of target’s characteristic, preliminary drafting of the target’s detailed list…96

It is mainly to carry out comprehensive analysis from the importance of all targets in the enemy’s operation system,
threat to our operation action, and feasibility for implementing target attack; analysis of sequence on targets; and
preliminary planning of the information operations target list.

(1) Analysis of the importance of the targets

The importance of the targets is reflected through the target’s structure, function, frequency spectrum, make-up, and
capability.

# 1. Analysis of target’s structure

Target’s structure is an organic body composed of many mutually connected target systems and with many existing
starting, connecting, and supporting points. If one can find the structural connecting point of the enemy’s target
system and carry out effective attack, then one can achieve the effect of “hitting the point to break the whole” and
“pulling a hair to activate the whole body.” The enemy’s command and control system, intelligence warning system, and
communications system are the connecting points in attack target’s system structure. During the Bekaa Valley war in
1982, from analysis, Israel discovered that the control center and radar system were the connecting points in target
structure of the Syrian air defense operation system and thus drew up an operation plan of attacking Syrian air defense
radar first. In a short six minutes, the 19 “SAM- $\cdot 6 ^ { \circ }$ missile base that Syria had worked very hard to
build up for 10 years, and spent US\$200 million on, had been blown to dust.

# 2. Analysis of the target’s function

Analysis of the target’s function is analysis of the relationship between the tasks of all substances in the information
system. From the angle of operation utilization, one should mainly analyze the following functions: first is the
information collection function that mainly has a warning detection system, intelligence reconnaissance system, and some
reconnaissance and warning facilities. Second is the information transmission function that has mainly communications
systems. Third is the information handling function that has mainly command and control systems. Through analysis of the
functions of targets, one can make target selection the “appropriate medicine for the symptom” that is favorable to
further analyze the target, thus making target selection much more accurate.

# 3. Analysis of target frequency spectrum

Through the analysis of the frequency spectrum of targets, one can ascertain the relationship between the working
frequencies of all substances in the target system and study the reflective form of the frequency spectrum that is used
by the target’s electromagnetic radiation. First is the analysis of the scope of frequency used and the scope of
frequency used is the area border of frequency that the target signal uses. Second is analysis of the frequency
distribution, and the frequency distribution is the distribution situation of target information in the entire frequency
area. The major operational frequency scope of an information facility (system) including radar, communications,
guidance, friend or foe recognition, wireless detonator, and guidance is between 1MHz to 300GHz. The frequency scope of
the optical electronic information facility (system) generally is above 300GHz. The frequency scope of an acoustics
information facility (system) is in the scopes of mid-wave, long wave, and super long wave including secondary acoustic
wave, acoustic wave, and super acoustic wave sections and it is the major wave section of sonar and underwater
navigation and positioning facility operations. Third is analysis of the target’s frequency used form. In terms of a
modulator type carrier, the frequency used form is the modulating method. The quantity of target’s modulating style is
specific, such as in communications area, regularly used simulating signals are amplitude modulator and frequency
modulator; digital signals are differential phase-shift keying, time differential phase-shift keying, frequency
differential phase-shift keying, time frequency differential phase-shift keying, encoding modulator, two-phase
phase-shift keying, and four-phase phase-shift keying.

# 4. Analysis of the target’s appropriation

The analysis of the target’s appropriation is mainly accomplished through analysis of point position, route, hub, and
region. First is the analysis of point position. Point position is the position in space occupied by various substances of a target system. The information link point has
basic space special characteristics and nature such as position, distribution, distance, and neighbor. In operation
under informatized conditions, point position is the information that should be first ascertained in command, control,
and strike. Second is analysis of the information route. Route can be used to describe the distance relationship,
connection relationship, and flowing relationship among the target’s information link points. One can further have a
handle of the information communications between the important information link points within the scope of a specific
area through information route analysis in order to provide an entrance point for information operations attack and the
relevant target selection. Third is analysis of hub. A hub is a crossing point with comparatively great value and a
prominent position for a large number of routes. The hub for information operation target system should mainly be the
location of the information facility (system) that has a comparatively large influence on the military struggle;
therefore, the location of a hub generally is also the location of the target selection’s key point. Fourth is region
analysis. A region is an abstract combination composed of space structures such as point position, route, and hub, and
it has specific form, area, and body. Generally, one can divide the category in the target system into core region,
important region, general region, bordering region, and unrelated region based on the degree and amount of importance of
the hub in the space.

# 5. Analysis of target’s capability

A target’s capability is mainly an expressive form of target information strength and generally, it can be carried out
through analysis of information transmission capacity, power density, and radiation source data. Information
transmission capacity is the largest information quantity that is transmitted within a unit time. Transmission of
information cannot leave out the support of the information system. The tasks of an information system are the
collection, transmission, storage, and management of information. Power density indicates the capability in a unit area
within a unit time: the larger the power density, the stronger the electromagnetic signal. In terms of electronic
jamming, insufficient jamming power and power density are very difficult to carry out jamming against a target.
Radiation source data is the number of radiation signal sources on the battlefield. Radiation source data within a unit
area can reflect the appropriation density of the information facility and the operational condition of the information
facility, combine the changing situation of target radiation source data in certain operation region or operation time,
and discover the in-depth level dynamic cause of its changes to provide decision-making basis for information operation
target selection.

# (2) Analysis of the threat from targets

The threat from targets is a prediction on a certain degree of threat from targets and is one of the major bases in
selection of information operations targets. It generally includes analysis of the threat effective factor of target,
analysis of the threat effective degree of a target, analysis of the threat index of a target, and analysis of the
threat level of a target.

1. Analysis of the threat effective factor of a target

The threat effective factor of a target indicates the substance or condition that creates influences on target’s threat
and is the major data that affects the sequence of an information operations target threat. When analyzing the threat
effective factor of a target, one must look into the effective factor in as much detail as possible. Information
operations targets can be divided into electronic attack target and network attack targets and electronic attack target
can be divided into four categories - radar targets, communications targets, optical electronic targets, and other
targets. Based on these, one can list the concrete threat effective factors; for example, the threat effective factors
of a target for radar generally are distance, repetitial frequency, carrier frequency, pulse width, antenna bearing
change, and radiation capacity.

# 2. Analysis of the threat effective degree of target

The threat effective factor of a target is the major data that affect the sequence of an information operations target’s
threat. Every threat effective factor has a corresponding threat effective degree or threat effective degree function
and the threat effective degree generally is a whole number between 0 – 100 and the bigger the number indicates the
bigger threat effective degree.

# 3. Analysis of the threat index of a target

The threat index of a target in information operations is a quantitative description of the threat degree of a target in
information operations. It is jointly determined by the attributive data (threat effective factor of the target),
battlefield environment, and concrete operation goal of the information operations target. The threat index of a target
in information operations combines situations such as the target’s battlefield environment and concrete operation goal,
and based on the combination of each threat effective degree data to obtain the threat index of the target in
information operations.

# 4. Analysis of the threat level of a target

The threat level of a target in information operations is a qualitative description of the threat degree of a target in
information operations. The value of the threat level is English capital letters $\mathbf { A } - \mathbf { E }$ with A
being the highest threat level and E being the lowest threat level. The corresponding relationship of the threat level
of a target in information operations is as follows:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Threat Index of Target</td><td>0-19</td><td>201 49</td><td>501 69</td><td>01 84</td><td>85-
100</td></tr></table></body></html>

<html><body><table><tr><td>Threat Degree of
Target</td><td>E</td><td>D</td><td>C</td><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Meaning in Threat</td><td>Small
est</td><td>Rather Small</td><td>General</td><td>Rather Big</td><td>Biggest</td></tr></table></body></html>

# (3) Analysis of the feasibility of target attack

Feasibility analysis in information operations target selection mainly includes analysis of the information operations
attack capability, analysis of the target’s destructibility, and analysis of the target’s recoverability.

# 1. Analysis of information operations attack capability

Information operations attack capability is the collective expression of the information operation capability and
technical expression of the weapons and equipment attack standard, and it requires combined effects and cooperative
support from multi aspects. The analysis of the information operations attack capability is connected to multi factors,
and the information supporting capability, command and control capability, information operations weapons and equipment
system attacking capability, and comprehensive safeguarding capability jointly constitute the information operations
attack capability. Each type of capability can be made in detail to a series of concrete indications, for example
indications such as battlefield information collection capability can be made in detail to information collection
probability, information collection timeline, information collection precision rate, information collection accuracy
rate, and information collection area scope. One can obtain the conclusion of each type of capability by carrying out a
comprehensive evaluation of the indication of that type of capability.

# 2. Analysis of target’s destructibility

A target’s destructibility is the possibility of the target’s function being weakened or damaged after the target is
attacked. A target’s destructibility includes the target’s protect capability and the target’s defense capability. A
target’s protect capability is the ability of the target to adopt its protection measure when the target of the attacked
party is attacked and it is the protect capability given to the target by outer power. A target’s defense capability is
the ability that the target has to defend against attack by the opposition. It can be further made in detail to counter
precision guidance weapon jamming capability, counter GPS jamming capability, counter friend or foe recognition jamming
capability, counter radar jamming capability, counter communications jamming capability, and counter optical electronic
jamming capability. With different targets, the attack action, defensive measure, and self defensive nature and measure
against the targets are also different; therefore, in analysis, one must carry out specific analysis on a specific target.

# 3. Analysis of target’s recoverability

A target’s recoverability is the target’s ability to recover its basic function after being attacked. Starting from the
basic component angle of the target, this type of capability can be made in detail to software recoverability and
hardware recoverability and through the analysis of these two capabilities, the evaluation can have the recoverability
conclusion of the target.

# V. Determine target detailed list, propose decision-making suggestion…102

Determining target detailed list and proposing decision-making suggestion are to carry out renewed determination and
inspection of the target based on the preliminary drafting target detailed list in order to ensure the accuracy and
scientific nature of the target detailed list and on this basis, also propose the relevant decision-making suggestion of
the target attack focusing on the target detailed list.

# (1) Inspection of the target’s information

A target’s information is one of the important bases for information operations target selection. Accuracy, timeliness,
and completeness are general standards for quality evaluation of a target’s information. Therefore, one must start from
the accuracy, timeliness and completeness of a target’s information when making inspection of target’s information.

1. Inspection on the accuracy of the target’s information

When making inspection on the accuracy of a target’s information, there should be first, a multi-channel testimony.
Through tightly combining information obtained by various methods such as satellite reconnaissance, air reconnaissance,
sea reconnaissance, land reconnaissance, as well as specialized reconnaissance, and man-made reconnaissance, the true
target’s information is captured to a maximum degree by mutually testifying and replenishing the collected information.
Second, there should be dependable levels that rationally classify the target’s information. The target’s information
should be classified according to its reliability during inspection and they are generally classified into three levels
– reliable, quite reliable, and unreliable.

2. Inspection of the timeliness of a target’s information

When carrying out target selection, one should always maintain communications with intelligence reconnaissance
departments and utilize various advanced intelligence collection, transmission, and handling measures to control the
first hand target’s information at the fastest speed within the possible shortest time. One should analyze and be in control of its time
effective scope in order for target selection to be coordinated with information time effectiveness.

3. Inspection on the completeness of a target’s information

When assuring target’s information, one must pay attention to the inspection of information completeness. One should
inspect and make clear its basic parameter on a single target and on the target system, one should make sure that there
are no missing targets, especially whether or not the information of a core target can satisfy the requirement in
information operations attack. At the same time, one should also recognize the scope of strike on target, so target
selection is within the specified scope and one must avoid selecting a target that is prohibited for strike.

(2) Evaluation on the effect of a target attack

Evaluation on the effect of target attack, in reality, is the analysis of whether or not the predicted result can be
created after an information operation attack is carried out based on the preliminary drafting target detailed list.

# 1. Evaluation of the political effect

Evaluation of the political effect is an analysis of whether or not it could achieve the result that is favorable in
realizing one’s own political goal after the target is attacked and of trying its best to lower and weaken the
realization of the enemy’s political goal. When selecting the information operations targets, one must focus on the
analysis of the political effect created by the evaluation of target attack, insist on the uniformity of military goal
and political goal, and pursue the maximum military and political effectiveness. The purpose of regional war under
informatized conditions is relatively limited; the connection among military, politic, economy, and diplomatic is much
closer; the result achieved by military action often is only one step toward the end in political resolution; and at the
end, military confrontation will have to return to the method of political resolution. Therefore, evaluation of the
political effect, in fact, is analysis and decision of whether or not a “reasonable, favorable, and moral” political
result will be created after selecting target and implementing attack.

# 2. Evaluation of military effect

The evaluation of military effect is an evaluation of whether or not effective system breakdown is created after the
attack action was adopted on the selected target. Information operations is a struggle carried out to weaken and damage
the enemy’s information and information system and at the same time, protect one’s own information and information
system from being damaged. There is a linking point in the information system that once it is damaged, it would cause a
chain reaction and lead to partial and even the entire system to break down, creating a domino effect. It would achieve
the effect of “hitting a point to damage the surface” and “pulling a hair to affect the entire body” when these linking
points targets are attacked. For example when the linking point and hub of a battlefield communication system and a
battlefield network system are effectively attacked, they could lead to the command and control system, early warning
detection system, and weapon and equipment system to be paralyzed and weaken and lower their operation capability.

# 3. Evaluation of psychological effect

Evaluation of psychological effect mainly is the effect created on the enemy’s recognition system after the target is
attacked. First of all, one should analyze the effect on the understanding and confidence of the enemy’s command
personnel; especially carry out evaluation of their understanding, judgment of the situation, decision on action, and
determination and willingness to counter attack on battlefield information. Just as the so-called “shoot the horse first
and then the rider, catch the head of the gangsters first and then the rest of the gangsters,” one should only be in
control of the psychological effect of the enemy’s command personnel to be in control of the major aspects of the issue.
Second, one should analyze the effect caused by the understanding and confidence of the general operation personnel by
analyzing, in focus, their operational attitude, operational emotion, operational spirit, and operational will. Third,
one should analyze the effect caused by the understanding and confidence of the enemy’s public by focusing on the
analysis of their attitude and feeling about war. Finally, one should evaluate the psychological effect caused by one’s
own allies, the enemy’s allies, and those who are neutral.

(3) Report the detailed list to the higher up and propose a suggestion for target strike

Under the informatized conditions and with the quickening of operational rhythm, the time for target selection is
lessening, the tendency for uniformity of target selection and strike is getting much clearer, and the traditional
method of following prescribed order of selection first and then strike can hardly meet the demand for information
operations. Therefore, for the convenience of inspection from the higher up and promoting uniformity of target selection
and strike, one should not just merely have a simple list of the targets when reporting the target detailed list to the
higher up, but should, at the same time, report the relevant suggestions on the basic situation and target strike when
reporting the target selection to the higher up.

# 1. Basic situation of target selection

The basic situation of target selection is a clear and concise conclusive report on the thinking and behavior process of
information operations target selection and the purpose is to provide assistance for the higher up inspection department
to quickly have an overall control of the target detailed list. Its content mainly includes the major bases, guiding
idea and basic principle, major method, key point and difficult issues that are already resolved, issues waiting to be resolved, and other situation on information operation target selection.

# 2. Relevant suggestion on the target strike

When reporting information operations target detailed list to the higher up, the purpose for providing a relevant
suggestion on the target strike is to make the target detailed list inspection departments understand the thinking of
their target selection; at the same time, it also provides a specific reference for adopting strike action against the
target. These suggestions mainly include: target attack time – combining operation stage division and proposing the
suggestion for the best timing to adopt strike action against the target; target strike force – based on the analysis
and understanding of one’s own operation force and operation capability, proposing suggestions on the distribution of
information operations strike force against the target; and target strike method – focusing on the operation method,
characteristic, and special parameters of the specific targets, proposing suggestion on the focal information operations
strike method.

# Chapter 6 Basic Fighting Methods of Joint Campaign Information Operations…106

Information operations serves as a type of brand new combat form, its content is extremely abundant, and due to the
changes in combat principles and combat environments, the fighting methods for the combat process of the information
operations are also multivariant, and so they should be based on the tasks and requirements of the information
operations. When the time, locations, and enemy situations are suitable, they should flexibly use the corresponding
fighting methods and strive for success in the information operations.

# Section 1: Establishing the Basic Requirements for the Fighting Methods of the Joint Campaign Information Operations…106

The fighting methods, which are the methods of combat, are an important component of combat theory. Within joint
campaign operations in the future, the information technology trends become clearer with each passing day and striving
for information dominance becomes more important with each passing day. Based on the tasks and requirements of the
Chinese military joint campaign, it involves the research of the basic fighting methods of joint campaign information
operations. It has an important significance, with regard to the guidance of the construction of the Chinese military
information operations forces, the enhancement of joint campaign information combat training, the increase in joint
campaign information operations combat capabilities, and finally, the commanding points and the grasp of the combat
initiative that they have in future information technology wars.

Joint campaign information operations are a new style of [end of page 106] joint combat operations of the local wars,
under information technology conditions, and it includes all of the basic characteristics that protect against the
possible operations that could be implemented by the enemy information systems and their facility attacks, and against
the possible operations against our information and information systems, as well as the basic characteristics of the
integrated duality and methods, the basic characteristics of the developmental trends, etc. When researching the
fighting methods of the joint campaign information operations, they must grasp the following points well:

# I. The integration of the objective physical foundations and the subjective dynamics…107

The establishment of the fighting methods must be based on a specific physical foundation and at the same time, it also
cannot neglect the subjective dynamic of the people. It should also accomplish the integration of the objective physical
foundation and the subjective dynamic. With regard to the Chinese military, establishing the fighting methods should be
based in the subjective realities of the Chinese military information operations weaponry, and the basic principles of the fighting methods should be placed on the foundation of the existing
information operations weaponry combat skills and functions. It should focus on the possible developments that could
occur in the near future, and it should fully bring out the function of the dynamic use of the subjective guidance and
the information operations potential of the people’s wars and form an entire military force.

# II. The integration of the focus on skills and the focus on theory…107

Combat has always been the measure of intelligence and strategy, but in modern advanced technology wars, it has fully
realized the determining function of the technology on the fighting methods. On one hand, they must focus on striving to
gain the fighting methods for information dominance, starting with technology and research. For example, “node
destruction” is an important fighting method for attacking enemy information systems, so what is the structure of the
enemy combat systems? Where are the key links for their command information systems? And how do we differentiate them,
interfere with them, and destroy them? What are the most effective methods to use to interfere with and destroy them?
How do we confirm the attacks were effective? With regard to the substantive nature of these issues, if they are not
deeply and technically analyzed, then we are stuck at summarizing the general characteristics and outwardly describing
them in a general fashion, which is not effective in solving the issues. On another hand, they must focus on using
strategic control and using methods for distributing technology, they must use the “asymmetric combat” that the Chinese
military established on the foundation of strategic superiority and the “killer” of the local advanced technology, in
order to cope with a strong enemy that is constructing an advanced technology superiority that regards information
superiority as the core, and against enemies that implement skillful and flexible asymmetric combat [end of page 107].

# III. The integration of the scientific quality and the artistic quality…108

The fighting methods are scientific and they are also artistic. Following the broad use of new and advanced technology
that has been given precedence, the extent of the scientific nature has continuously increased. However, after all is
said and done, combat is a type of complex, societal phenomenon of intense fighting, and thereby it provides a broad
scope of operations for the art of combat. Within the joint campaign information operations of the future, using the
unique function of “soft kill” as the preference for striving for information dominance determines that the most
appropriate integration is on the emphasis of the scientific nature and artistic quality. There is a complementary
relationship between the scientific nature and the artistic quality. The fighting methods of joint campaign information
operations include a large amount of standardized, procedural, and logical stable content, and therefore, they must
abide by certain scientific principles; furthermore, they also include many non-standardized, non-procedural, and
non-logical unstable content, and therefore they must also be adept at being flexible and defeating their opponent by
using surprise moves. For example, in the words of our forefathers: “Carrying out operations is methodical but it does not make laws. War does not make laws and it is
methodical.”

# IV. The integration of carrying on and development…108

Joint campaign information operations are a combat realm that is in the middle of rapid developmental change and
furthermore, the focus of the offensive and defensive technology measures and methods of the information realms is
strong, the benefits of the repeated use are low, and these characteristics determine that they must focus on the
continuous innovation of the fighting methods. This type of attempt to use the glories of the past wars to re-cast the
glories of future ones only results in the regulations of “no longer being victorious,” being defeated. Moreover, during
the past exercises of the Chinese military in the past revolutionary wars, a complete set of fighting methods that have
been superior, successful, and excellent has been created, its essence has an important guiding significance on fighting
in the information realm, and it should combine the new situations in order to creatively carry forward and develop the
traditional fighting methods. The information era allows the life cycle of the military theory, which includes the
fighting methods within it, to be continuously reduced, it allows for the farsightedness of the urgent requirements for
the research of the fighting methods to be moderate, and this puts forth a strong response for a requirement to
challenge future combat, and it is also the draw for the requirements of the previous joint campaign information
operations weaponry of the Chinese military to develop and to develop the construction of the troops [end of page 108].

# Section 2: Joint Campaign Information Attack Fighting Methods…109

Information attack focuses on striving for and protecting information dominance, under the unified command of the joint
campaign commanders and their commanding organizations, using specialized information attack forces and non-traditional
forces, adopting electronic interference, electronic spoofing, computer virus attacks, and network infiltration,
military sabotage and firepower destruction, psychological attacks, and other integrated measures, as well as destroying
and weakening the enemy’s information systems, to the maximum extent possible, in order to use effective, active,
offensive combat operations. Its basic fighting methods are:

# I. Information deterrence methods…109

Information deterrence methods refer to the collective use of a relatively large amount of information attack troops and
military equipment in one or several directions, the adoption of electronic feigning, electronic jamming, network
attacks, psychological spoofing, anti-chemical destruction and precision attacks, and other measures, as well as other
corresponding campaign deterrence operations that create a formidable information attack momentum and form a
psychological perspective. It is a type of information attack fighting method that shocks the enemy military, causing
the enemy to not dare to hastily conduct operations or it causes the enemy to submit because of their fear. Moreover,
with regard to the military forces and firepower deterrence, information deterrence can achieve the deterrence
objectives and it can also reduce the political and foreign affairs combat restrictions. The actual forces that
implement formidable information deterrence methods are even more effective, so much so that they can even achieve the
objective of “not fighting but being the victims of war.” However, when strong forces are faced with the weak they also
do not really accomplish anything; they only are adept at transforming from the bad to the good. They transform their
inferior position, in general, to a superior position, specifically, and they implement vigorous information deterrence
against the enemy. They mitigate or restrict the information superiority of the enemy, which means they do not allow the
enemy to achieve the results of “not fighting but being the victims of war,” and it also can cause the enemy personnel
to generate feelings of fear and panic, which cripples their combat willpower and then they will not hastily conduct
operations. During the “Desert Shield” operations in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the United States military urgently
mobilized all types of forces to adjust their troops and send their generals and high officers to the Persian Gulf
regions [end of page 109], while they implemented psychological warfare deterrence through all types of news media,
where they greatly exaggerated their electronic warfare results and declared that “they were intently focused on the
mobilization situation of Saddam’s troops.” This caused the spirits of the Iraqi military to be at a high point and they
were not willing to conduct hasty operations, thereby effectively concealing the dispatch and deployment of the United
States armed forces. In the 1960s, when the Taiwanese military was vigorously making preparations to counter large
attacks, the Chinese military had defeated the enemy, and through the organization of a large array of electronic
feigning activities, they created errors in the assessment of the Taiwanese military situation and they concealed the
mobilization of the Chinese military. They could then leisurely complete their countermeasure preparations, which
allowed their countermeasure plans to be aborted.

The use of information deterrence methods, one, is the full use of broadcasts, television programs, publications,
Internet, and other news media to propagate the outstanding functions of the Chinese weaponry and the mixture of truth
and lies about the military strength when assigning the operations, etc., as well as significantly publicizing the
preparations of the Chinese information attacks. This causes the enemy officers to have feelings of panic, even to the
point of leading to the enemy organizations and agencies being frightened and it shakes their belief in their fighting
capabilities. Two, they should flexibly organize the electronic feigning activities, the electronic disguises, and their
electronic jamming on the enemy information systems, their network spoofing, and their virus attacks. Three, they should
use virtual reality technology to create a formidable Chinese information offensive, supplementing the essential
military feigning activities, warning and frightening the other side, and forcing the enemy to give in. Four, they
should use anti-radiation guided missiles, anti-radiation unmanned aircraft, etc. They should implement the “eye-gouging
military tactics” against the enemy which serve as the early warning survey radar for the “eyes” of the command
information systems, and they should use precision guided weaponry to implement their “pinpoint tactics” on the enemy
command and control centers, communications centers, computer network nodes, and other strategic point objectives, which
increases their deterrence results.

# II. Information blocking methods…110

Information blocking methods refers to the collective use of the superior information attack troops, within a specific
time, on the enemy electronic information systems in a certain area, to implement a large scale suppression of
electronic jamming, which combines the use of radio communication disguise, network spoofing, and other measures. They
sever the communications and networks of the enemy with the outside world and they confuse their radar and
photoelectricity reconnaissance, and they block the enemy information attack fighting methods of the enemy, within the
electronic information realm. The objective of this fighting method lies in severing the full electronic information
connection with the portion of the upper level authorities and friendly neighbors [end of page 110], creating a
partially closed off status on the battlefield, in order to create beneficial conditions for the Chinese campaign combat
groups on the isolated and scattered enemies, to break them up and surround them, and use all types of attacks on them.
During the Battle of Stalingrad, the Soviet military, during the implementation of the preparation phase of their
countermeasures against the German military and during the execution process, used radio telephones to specially create
interference and destroy the information connections between the six groups of German military units that had been
surrounded, and the “Don” military groups, so they could obtain the successful experience of using information blocking
methods. The Chinese military, during the self-defense war against Vietnam, also successfully used “information
blocking” methods and stopped the radio communications between the Vietnamese military artillerymen at the observation
posts and the artillerymen in the battlefield, which obstructed their information transmissions.

In order to use information blocking methods, first, they must reasonably determine the blocking objectives. Due to the
increase in the degree of transparency of the information technology battlefields, it has caused the information
blocking, in its normal significance, to become more and more difficult. Implementing information blocking against the
enemy does not mean they seek to obtain full information blocking and restrictions against the enemy, but they should
determine the specially designated enemy military targets to block, within the scope of a certain time and space. The
second is that they must integrate the use of different types of methods to implement the strict blockages. At the same
time as severing the communications with the outside world, they should implement a strong and stifled interference of
the enemy electronic information systems, especially the radio communications with the outside world, and they should,
based on the fear of the enemy, isolation and aide, contact, and other situations, flexibly adopt radio communications
disguises, transmit false intelligence, and other spoofing measures, and then they can draw the enemy into an ambush so
they can dupe and mislead them. The third is that they must promptly evaluate and fully use the blocking results.
Regardless of what types of information blocking methods they use, they must promptly evaluate the blocking plans and
the implementation of results, and based on the requirements, they must promptly adjust their blocking plans and
guarantee the continuous blockade of the enemy within that certain time. Furthermore, they must closely coordinate with
each of the campaign groups (combat groups) and troops, fully use the information blocking results, and implement intense surrounding and annihilation of the enemy [end of page 111].

# III. Information campaign methods…112

Information campaign methods refers to the information attack fighting methods that use electronic disguises, electronic
feigning activities, network spoofing, and other information spoofing methods, to conceal the Chinese campaign attempts,
as well as their deployments and operations, to confuse, dupe and move the enemy personnel, to cause the intelligence of
the enemy to be inaccurate, and to create mistakes in the assessments and judgments of the enemy, in an attempt to form
a favorable condition for the Chinese military or for them to achieve suddenness in their campaign attacks. The
information campaign methods are the embodiment and use of campaign stratagems in the information warfare realm. On
future information technology battlefields, through each of the types of information campaigns, with regard to the
command of the Chinese military strategic superiority, winning the battlefield initiative has an extremely important
significance.

With regard to using the information campaign methods, first of all, it is based on the overall campaign situation. The
information campaign methods are an organic component of the campaign rally, and they must obey the campaign objectives,
in order to coordinate hiding the truth with the combat operations, and to coordinate exposing the falsities with the
combat situations. When it is used in each operation of the information campaign, it must comply with the fundamental
principles of the campaign operations, it must accomplish being lifelike in shape and form, and it cannot show its weak
points. The second is that it must focus on integrating the campaigns. The information campaigns must acquire the
predetermined results, and looking at it from the segment of spoofing the information exchange of the enemy, there are
three segments that are indispensable, which are to dupe the enemy battlefield reconnaissance equipment, systems, and
personnel; to dupe the enemy intelligence departments; and to dupe the enemy commanders. The information campaign must
be combined with the firepower campaigns and the military troop campaigns, and each of the directions, each of the
spaces, and each of the phases of the campaign must also be combined, so that they are capable of duping the enemy
personnel, to the maximum extent possible. The third is that the information campaign must be combined with the
information defense. Whether or not the information campaign is successful, to a certain degree, determines the
information security protection results of the Chinese. Furthermore, concealing the Chinese information systems is also
one of the pieces of content of the information campaigns. Therefore, during the implementation of the information
campaigns, they must adopt strict confidentiality and security measures to strengthen the information defense, in order
to guarantee the campaign results.

# IV. Information pollution methods…112

Information pollution methods refers to the information attack fighting methods that [end of page 112] obstruct and
infringe on the enemy information transmission channels, through the intentional overload of false, useless, and
malicious information at the enemy, which destroys the corresponding information that the enemy uses, and pollutes the
operational environment of the enemy information systems, in order to achieve the effects of restricting the normal
command of the enemy information systems. This fighting method mainly implements attacks against the enemy information
network systems, and through the wired or wireless channels, it infiltrates the internal enemy networks, so they can
issue false information, and send out or launch the hacker procedures and viruses, to reduce the efficiency of the enemy
network communications, and destroy the use of complete, accurate, and useful information on the enemy networks, which
finally causes the enemy to not be able to normally use the information systems, which decreases the overall combat of
the enemy and their command capabilities.

With regard to the use of the information pollution methods, first of all, they should implement information
obstruction. Though the large amount of false information and useless information that is disseminated against the enemy
information systems, it creates an “information torrent,” which obstructs and infringes upon the enemy information
transmissions channels, which causes the enemy information systems to be saturated and overloaded. This destroys the
prompt collection, transmission, and processing of all of the essential enemy information, which ultimately cripples and
even paralyzes the information systems. The second is that they should implement destruction through the use of viruses.
The use of wireless viruses to empty into the technology equipment uses different types of viruses to get into the enemy
information networks, infecting the enemy network information centers, as well as their important nodes and terminals,
and then, through the remote issuing of orders, it activates the launch of the virus, which implements destruction of
the enemy information networks, deletes and revises its data and leads to the enemy systems killing the computer and
collapsing it. The third is that it implements external pollution. Using all types of gas heating and cooling systems
and fog and smoke equipment, they can use all types of methods to combine native and foreign methods, to confuse the
enemy information reconnaissance systems, and through the transmission of all kinds of useless or harmful information
onto the enemy information channels or information sources, it influences and reduces the operational effectiveness of
the enemy information systems and weakens the enemy information operations capabilities.

# V. Information paralysis methods…113

The information paralysis methods are the integrated use of electronic interference, physical destruction, and other
hardware and software methods, to separately implement attacks against the enemy information reconnaissance subsystems,
information transmission subsystems, and information processing subsystems, to sever their mutual connections and
destroy the integrity of the enemy information systems, causing them to have difficulty in effectively bringing out their functions. This is mainly through the destruction of
nodes to achieve the objective of paralyzing [end of page 113] the systems. Specifically speaking, it concentrates the
military forces and military weapons of the information attacks and determines the strategic position of the function
(nodes) against the enemy information systems, in order to implement electronic interference, virus attacks, and
firepower destruction, in order to reduce or destroy the overall combat effectiveness of the enemy information systems.
These nodes refer to the strategic positions and crucial points that determine the function for these entire information
systems. This normally includes the command and control modules of the information systems, the communications exchange
centers, such as the command centers of the information systems, as well as each of the centers of the subsystems, the
early warning command organizations of the airspace above the battlefield, the main trunk line nodes of the regional
communications systems, the command post communications centers of the command networks, the intelligence reporting
stations of the radar networks, etc.

With regard to using the information paralysis methods, the first is that on the basis of implementing reconnaissance
and analysis on the enemy information systems, they must accurately select and determine the key nodes. Using the mobile
subscriber equipment (MSE) of the United States military, in the areas of military and commanders as the example, the
coverage area of this system can reach $1 5 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 5 0$ square kilometers, it is comprised of 42 central
nodes, and it uses wireless radio relay equipment to connect the nodes. If these nodes happen to be destroyed, the
information systems can be easily bogged down and paralyzed, and they cannot be used normally. The second is that during
the implementation of the attacks on the nodes, they must assemble the military forces, integrate the use of all types
of information combat forces, use a combination of the electronics attacks and network attacks, combine conventional
combat and specialized combat, combine the soft kill and hard destruction, in order to swiftly and violently gain
dominance, break through the enemy information defense, and implement a strong degree of damages on the important
objectives, causing a period that is hard to recover from, thereby guaranteeing the attack results.

# Section 3: Joint Campaign Information Fighting Methods…114

Information defense refers to the information system protection as well as the information security measures and
activities that are combined with the information attacks, in order to protect the security of the information and
information systems of the Chinese, based on the unified plan of the joint campaign commanders as well as their
information combat commanding organizations, and it guarantees [end of page 114] the collection, transmission, and
processing, and application capabilities of the information. Furthermore, it is the content that has been adopted that
regards the anti-reconnaissance, anti-interference, anti-destruction, and anti-computer attacks as the important
content. The main tasks of the information defense include three aspects, the protection of the information system
security, the information security confidentiality, and the psychological defense. The protection of the information
systems security is mainly done through the anti-reconnaissance, anti-destruction, anti-attacks, and other methods,
which are used to protect the normal operations of the Chinese systems. The information security confidentiality is
mainly done through the information encryption, information concealing, identity discrimination, and other methods,
which protect against enemy eavesdropping, protect against the enemy cracking the code, and protect against distortion,
which protect the security of the Chinese combat information, its integrity, and its use. The psychological defense is
mainly the use of communications, broadcasts, television, networks, and other modern communications media, to one, use
the principles of psychology to enhance the spread of education of patriotism, to stimulate and encourage the military
and the people to participate in the supportive feelings of the war, and to establish a firm belief that they will not
fail; furthermore, it exposes the scattered falsities and erroneous information, that they are facing from the enemy’s
psychological warfare operations that they could adopt, through the technological measures that can destroy the
psychological battle, in order to achieve the objectives of the morale of the soldiers.

The fundamental fighting methods of information defense are: information concealing methods, information deception
methods, information central network methods, and information protective screen methods.

# I. Information concealing methods…115

Information concealing methods refers to the type of information defense methods that use integrated radiation control,
signal concealing, and other measures, to conceal the major electronic information systems of the Chinese, to the
maximum degree possible, as well as their true information of the radiation, in order to prevent or reduce the enemy
from effective electronics reconnaissance and anti-radiation destruction. Regardless of whether it is before the war or
during the war, information concealing is the most fundamental method of information defense.

With regard to the use of information concealing methods, number one, they must control the information. The control of
the information refers to the probability of reducing the enemy interception of our electromagnetic information, under a
unified plan, in order to complete the most restricted prerequisite conditions of all of the required tasks, through the
control of our radiation times and radiation scopes of our information system electromagnetic capabilities [end of page
115]. The control of the radiation times refers to the probability of reducing the exposed time that the electromagnetic
waves are in the air, and reducing the opportunities for the Chinese information to be scouted or intercepted by the
enemy, thereby decreasing the Chinese information from being destroyed by the enemy’s anti-radiation methods, electronic
interference, network attacks, and firepower attacks. The specific methods are to strictly control the direction and
degree of electromagnetic radiation, to strictly control the amount and time of the information transmission, to
simplify the electronic documents, to condense the connection times, and furthermore, they should implement effective
electronic interference against the enemy electronics reconnaissance equipment, and reduce the reconnaissance effectiveness of the enemy. The scope of the radiation control is to control the radiation direction and
distance of the system electromagnetic waves, and to create as large of a reconnaissance blind area as possible for the
enemy. Radio systems, under the prerequisite of guaranteeing the completion of the tasks, must insist upon the power
being small rather than big. The position of the accurate and reasonable deployment of the launch equipment, and the
prevention of forming an excessive concentration of electronic launch points, uses the deployment of the reasonable
optimization to enhance the information defense. Second of all, they must conceal the signal. The concealment of
information is the increased concealment that is used to avoid the enemy’s reconnaissance of our electromagnetic
information and the corresponding characteristics of the electromagnetic spectrum and the information content. The
specific methods include: the concealment of the spectrum, using spread spectrum communications, frequency hopping
communications, burst communications, and other technology methods, in order to reduce the probability of the signal
spectrum exposure; the concealment of the electronic documents, using encrypted technology in each segment of the
communications; and the information characteristics of the concealed signal. With regard to using the concealed defense
methods, they must be flexible to changes, and they must respond quickly. In the 1960s, the Chinese Air Force guided
missile troops and the electronics of the high altitude Taiwanese reconnaissance aircraft under United States control
during the war, created “close and quick fighting methods,” which is the model for the flexible use of concealed defense
methods. After the enemy aircraft used the electronic early warning systems to discover our ground to air guided
missiles and guided radar electromagnetic waves, they mobilized and evaded. Our air defense troops formulated the “close
and quick fighting methods,” which were that the guided radar would suddenly open up their antennas (or increase the
high pressure) at close distances, it would quickly seize the objective, quickly implement the anti-jamming measures,
simplify the command procedures and the attack instructions, and quickly launch the guided missiles, which caused the
aircraft of the invaders to not have enough time to mobilize, succeed in escaping, and implement effective electronics
interference. The core of the “close and quick fighting methods” is the two words, “close” and “quick.” “Close” is to
conceal the electromagnetic radiation and combat intentions of the Chinese, and [end of page 116] “quick” is, under the
situations of the concealed electromagnetic radiation, the essential selections for completing the combat tasks, or else
they could hinder the military operations. The mobilization flexibility and rapid response ideology that are reflected
in the “close and quick fighting methods” have a general guiding significance for the other information defense methods
as well as the information fighting methods.

# II. Information deception method…117

Information deception method refers to each of the types of technology and the war technology measures that are jointly
used for information deception, which uses the combination of feigning activities, simulations, and posing activities,
the integration of information source deception, information channel deception, and information content deception, as
well as concealing the real and exposing the fake information, thereby achieving the information defense methods for implementing concealment and camouflage of the Chinese information and
information systems.

The information deception can be implemented through various types of methods. Based on the objectives and results of
the deception, information deception can be divided into three types: concealment style deception, obscure style
deception, and guided style deception. The main objective of concealment style deception is to obtain the source of the
information through the analysis of the enemy of their methods to “conceal the truth” by concealing their information,
thereby guaranteeing the real information source is not discovered. During the implementation of the concealment style
deception, what is normally used is the strict technology feigning activities, especially the implementation of stealth
technology and encryption and decreasing the information leaks to their lowest levels. The obscure style deception is
mainly the information volume of each type of information, through the increase and authentication of information that
does not conform or is fundamentally contrasting or contradictory, causing the enemy to waste large amounts of time and
energy during their information collection, discrimination, transmission, and processing, so they are not able to face
the various types of possibilities, making it hard to accept or reject it, making it hard to put forth effective and
accurate analyses and assessments, and thereby making them do many types of preparations, scattering their forces, or
causing them to finally distinguish the true information. It also causes them to put off the time for doing the
assessments and for adopting the correct measures, thereby losing their initiative. The guided style deception makes the
situations that are opposite of the actual information or the situations that do not comply have a high degree of
“authenticity,” through increasing the degree of clarity of the deceptive information, thereby causing the enemy to
neglect the genuine information or make the genuine information the false situation, even treating it as the duped
information, and ultimately making erroneous decisions. In the specific implementation [end of page 117], they should
combine the actual situations of the time to determine the types of deceptive measures that they should adopt.

With regard to using the information deception methods, one, they must direct it against different equipment and use
corresponding feigning fighting methods. The information feigning is focused against the enemy’s high resolution
reconnaissance equipment and relatively strong firepower attack capabilities. On the foundation of having highly
effective security configurations, they should use each type of feigning technology on the information systems to
implement focused feigning, protecting it from enemy destruction, and decreasing the enemy information attack
effectiveness. The exercises have proven that the feigning, even in highly technical battles, can still have a
relatively good function. Therefore, we must focus on the feigning work of the information systems. With regard to the
different electronics equipment, we must use corresponding feigning methods, and we must pay attention to the specific
characteristics of the equipment, as well as to implementing the feigning as we please. With regard to the important
objectives, they can use ground decoys, camouflage nets, metal angles of reflection, invisible paint, and other
equipment to implement strict feigning. They can also use smoke screens, etc. to implement concealed feigning, in order
to decrease the reconnaissance results of the enemy electrical equipment. Two is that they need to combine disguising the truth and revealing the falsities. The disguise of the truth is to do the information feigning
work well, causing the enemy personnel “to not see,” and to “not be able to attack” the Chinese electronics equipment.
Revealing the falsities is “to reveal false appearances to the enemy,” namely through each type of deceptive measure,
such as implementing radio feigning, using corner reflectors and false command posts and battle locations, etc. of the
false equipment, mixing together the false and real, causing the enemy to erroneously see and erroneously attack,
effectively adjusting the enemy information attack capabilities, and shielding the normal use of the Chinese electronics
information systems. “Revealing the truth” is intentionally revealing a few of the important Chinese electronics
objectives to the enemy, in order to attract their implementation of reconnaissance and jamming, to reach the objectives
for protecting the overall information systems. During the Kosovo War, the NATO military forces used methods such as
iron underneath the areas where bonfires were set, old gun barrels filled with boiling water, and hanging corner
reflectors on both sides of the highways, etc. Within the surrounding regions of the actual goals, they simulated each
type of signal source, they disguised them into various fake objectives, such as tanks, cannons, guided missile sites,
etc., and successfully deceived the NATO reconnaissance, wasting much of the ammunition of the enemy, and also
protecting against their own actual objectives from being attacked. Furthermore, the radar, guided missile troops,
armored forces, and mechanized forces, on the foundation of good disguises, often modified their configuration [end of
page 118], causing NATO to find it very difficult to scout the accurate positions, thereby having no way to implement
the attacks. The third is that the information sources, information channels, and intelligence deception should be
combined. The information source deception is the establishment of false information radiation sources, which attract
the enemy electromagnetic information reconnaissance and attack forces and equipment. When the enemy is distinguishing
our information sources from the false targets, we can change the false to be the true, using the “false launch source”
to transmit the electromagnetic signal. The information channel deception is, during the electromagnetic information
transmission process, based on the requirement for agreeing on the frequent transmission of information transmission
channels, the coexistence of both the true and false information channels, which increases the degree of difficulty for
the enemy reconnaissance. The intelligence deception is the use of all types of measures, especially the use of the
information intelligence analysis systems that regard the permitted operations and the command controls as the priority,
which cleverly carries out the schemes, and deceives the intelligence collecting and processing analysis systems of the
enemy.

# III. Information network method…119

The information network method refers to the information defense methods that fully use multiple types of electronic
information equipment and systems to adopt different organizational formats and methods, based on the netted shape
structure for the implementation of the configuration of the equipment on the information systems, during the campaign
fighting, to optimize the structure, to guarantee that things are confused, that some things are blind and some are
clear, some are suspended, and some go through, in order for the systems to completely be capable of effective
anti-interference, antidestruction, and anti-stealth.

With regard to the use of the information network methods, the first is that in the aspects of the communications
electronics defense, they can use the radio platforms, radio relays, and every type of wired communications method
structure, to freely connect to and link to circuitous netted shaped systems, through the optimization of the system
structures and configurations, to increase the electronics defense capabilities of the systems. Within a certain scope,
they can also combine the communications networks, duplex radio mobile communications networks, single radio
communications networks, tactical satellite communications networks, scattered communications networks, etc., to form an
integrated field communications system with a combination of all types of network structures and formats, so they can
increase the integrated communications support capabilities, and so they can also improve the information defense levels
of the system, from a fundamental standpoint. The second is that with regard to the radar electronics defense aspects,
the structure has “four defense” functions for the area radar network air defense system, which jointly uses the typical
examples of the network defense methods. During modern combat, the use of the air defense radars faces [end of page 119]
the threats of four types of advanced electronics combat, reconnaissance interference, anti-radiation weapon attacks,
stealth aircraft attacks, and guided missile attacks. With regard to a single radar station or radar system, with regard
to the improvement of a single type technology, it is very difficult to effectively counter the four types of threats
that can simultaneously exist on the modern battlefield. They can use each type of different radar structure, based on
the reasonable structural deployment, to make one radar technology system, and under the unified command, they can form
an area radar network air defense system that has the “four defense” functions. They can implement system warfare with
the enemy, and they can fully bring out the limited technology equipment functions of the Chinese military. During the
optimization of the system structure, they can gradually integrate the new technology into the systems, making the old
equipment newer, and effectively countering the sudden emergence of new threats. During the Second World War, the
British established a radar network that was comprised of twenty different radar stations, which obtained the amount and
courses of the German aircraft, and other information, in advance, which accomplished a great achievement for combating
the German air raids.

# IV. Information screen method…120

The information screen method is a type of information defense method that jointly uses sourced and passive electronics
interference and other measures, against the enemy implementation of interference with electronics reconnaissance
systems in specially designated directions and regions, and using specialized networks, specialized protocols, and other
methods, to physically or logically isolate the connection between important information systems and external systems,
as well as weaken the electronic reconnaissance and network reconnaissance capabilities of the enemy against our
important directions or regions.

With regard to using the information screen method, the first is that they must implement fixed direction
electromagnetic screens. The fixed direction electromagnetic screens are mainly used in the forward position of the
Chinese military electronic information systems. Using the throwing style or display style interference equipment, it
uses the radiation direction of the electromagnetic interference aimed at the reconnaissance stations in the direction
of the enemy, and it implements obstruction style or aimed style interference against the enemy. Under the prerequisite
of not affecting our own communications, it causes the enemy to not be able to scout our own communications and the
communications between us and the enemy, and it establishes an intangible fixed direction electromagnetic screen. The
second is that it implements regional electromagnetic screens. The regional electromagnetic screens are directed against
the many reconnaissance stations that the enemy has deployed within the campaign and battle areas, which causes them to
implement close interference on the throwing type jammers being used, or implementing airborne interference against the
enemy unmanned aircraft that the enemy has used to get into the airspace of the battlefield [end of page 120]. They must
form a specific standardized regional electromagnetic screen. They can also use the aircraft and vessels between the
enemy radar, communications reconnaissance, and photoelectricity probe equipment and our information systems, to deploy
a certain thickness and surface area of chaff, gas sol, smoke shell bomb, and other passive interference sources, in
order to weaken the survey capabilities of the enemy radar and photoelectric equipment on our operational goals. The
fixed electromagnetic screen and regional screens prevent the enemy implementation of the interference
anti-reconnaissance functions and the implementation of the reconnaissance against our communications centers and
information networks, and their common characteristics are to attack in order to assist in the prevention. Furthermore,
they must pay attention to the implementation under unified commands, and they cannot, during the interference of the
enemy, affect the normal communications of the Chinese military. They must also do the interference analysis work well,
and promptly achieve the feedback of information of the interference results, in order to make progress in improving the
preparation conditions for the interference methods or interference styles. The third is that they must implement
specialized network isolations. The specialized network isolations refer to the use of individual physical specialized
networks or logical simulated networks, to promptly use the specialized network protocols and other methods, starting
from severing the levels of the relationship of the foundational networks and the other networks, and actively
preventing the outside personnel from looking into or damaging the networks. The communications systems, command and
control systems, guided missile location systems, etc. of the Soviet military mainly used this type of technology and
methodology, and due to the foundational core of the information systems being open, it increased the
anti-reconnaissance and attack capabilities. In future joint campaigns, the Chinese military should also, on the
foundation of guaranteeing the necessary connection of the joint commands, clearly define the corresponding specialized
network boundaries and they must use effective network isolation measures, in order to increase the overall security and
protection levels. [end of page 121, end of chapter]

# Chapter 7 Joint Campaign Information Operations Command System of Systems [SoS] {zhihui tixi}…122

Studying the establishment of a joint campaign information operations (IO) command system $\{ zhi hui tiz h i \}$ ,
straightening out the command relationships {zhuhui guanxi} of the IO strengths {liliang} of all services and arms
{junbingzhong}, and forming an IO integrated-whole composite strength $\{ zhe ngt i ~ hel i \}$ are the issues which
must first need resolution in implementing joint campaign IO command.

# Section 1: The Necessity of Establishing a Joint Campaign IO Command SoS…122

The joint campaign IO command SoS signifies an integrated whole {zhengti} composed of a joint campaign’s various IO
command institutions $\{ zhi hui jig o u \}$ , according to certain relationships and functions {zhineng}. A rational
joint campaign IO command SoS has important significance for ensuring the high efficiency $\{ gao xia o \}$ and
stability of joint campaign IO command.

# I. Needs and requirements {xuyao} for realizing the joint campaign operational intent {zuozhan yitu}…122

In joint campaign operations under informationized {xinxihua} conditions, whether [we] can seize and maintain air
dominance/supremacy {zhikongquan}, sea dominance {zhihaiquan}, and dominance $\{ kon gzh iqu a n \}$ of the battlefield,
and thus ultimately gain success in joint campaign operations, first of all is dependent on whether [we] can seize
information dominance {zhixinxiquan}. To this end, within joint campaign operational command {zuozhan zhihui}, [we] must
strengthen IO command. By establishing a joint campaign [end of page 122] IO command SoS, [we] enable commanders
{zhihuiyuan} to tightly center on the general intention {zong qitu} of the joint campaign operations, thoroughly
organize the IO attack and defense activities {gongfang xingdong}, to the maximum extent convert the latent ability
{qianneng} of omni-service and arm {zhu junbingzhong} IO into actual capability for IO, and thus employ effective IO
activities to ensure the realization of the joint campaign intent.

# II. The basis for smoothly implementing IO…123

The joint campaign IO strength composition {liliang goucheng} is complex, and the mission types {renwu leixing} are
diversified, so if the command relationships cannot be straightened out, that could bring about the phenomenon of chaos
$\{ wux u \}$ in operational activities {zuozhan xingdong}. Hence, only by placing the IO strengths of all services and
arms under unified command and control [C2] {tongyide zhihui kongzhi}, according to the requirements {yaoqiu} of joint
campaign command, can [commanders] tightly center on realizing the general objectives {zongti mubiao} of joint campaign
IO, and implement the individual IO activities [of these strengths].

# III. Prerequisites {qianti} for bringing into play the integrated-whole effectiveness {zhengti xiaoneng} of the IO strengths…123

The joint campaign IO means are diversified, its strengths complex, and its degree of difficulty in coordination
{xietong} high. Only by establishing a joint campaign IO command SoS, to implement centralized unified command {jizhong
tongyi zhihui} of IO, can [commanders] synthetically [comprehensively] apply {zonghe yunyong} multiple IO means, fully
bring into play the respective strong points of multiple IO strengths, adjustcoordinate $\{ xie tia o \}$ them
consistently, and closely complement {miqie peihe} them, to form an integrated-whole composite strength for IO, and
bring into play the maximum operational effectiveness {zuozhan xiaoneng}.

# IV. Objective requirements for the development of a joint campaign command system {tizhi}…123

The requirements for a joint campaign operational command system are as follows: rationalness of the command division of
labor {zhihui fengong}, clarity of the command authority limits $\{ zhi hui qua nxi a n \}$ , flexibility of command
modes {zhihui fangshi linghuo}, and optimality of command effects {zhihui xiaoguo zuiyou}. These requirements, when
organizing and implementing joint campaign IO, mandate the establishment of the corresponding command institutions, to
strengthen the command of IO and to fully bring into play the effectiveness of IO. This is because of the following:
first is that the main duty $\{ zhi z e \}$ of the joint campaign commander [JCC] {lianhe zhanyi zhihuiyuan} is to
command {tongling} the joint campaign’s overall situation $\{ qua nju \}$ , so he can only carry out macroscopic command
$\{ hon ggu anz hih u i \}$ of the IO activity {huodong}. The specific command {juti zhihui} work of IO can only be
assumed by the corresponding IO command institutions. Second is that IO is an operational activity jointly conducted by
professional IO-issues strengths {zhuanye xinxi zuozhan wenti liliang} and nonprofessional IO strengths. [end of page
123] The requirements on their command are stringent, and thus require having specialized command institutions to
implement command per their functions {zhineng} and principles. For example, within information offense $\{ xin xij ing
ong \}$ , [commanders] must, by organizing and using the various information offensive strengths, restrict the bringing
into play of the effectiveness of the enemy information systems $\{ xin xix ito n g \}$ ; and within information defense
{xinxi fangyu}, [they] must, by organizing and adjusting-coordinating the various information support strengths {xinxi
baozhang liliang}, weaken the degree of harm from the enemy’s information attacks.9 This special quality {teshuxing} of
command activity {zhihui huodong} has determined the objective quality $\{ keg uan xin g \}$ in establishing a joint
campaign IO command SoS. Third is that following on the increasing prominence of the position and role $\{ diw eih ezu
oyo n g \}$ of the IO developing on the basis of electronic warfare [EW] {dianzizhan}, it is fully necessary to explore
{tansuo} the problems of joining the tracks $\{$ {接轨 jiegui} between a joint campaign IO command SoS and the joint
campaign command system $\{ tiz h i \}$ .

# Section 2: The Basic Principles Which Should Be Followed in Establishing a Joint Campaign IO Command SoS…124

The joint campaign IO command SoS is a component {zucheng bufen} of our military’s joint campaign operational command
SoS $\{ tix i \}$ , and is an organic integrated whole of many levels $\{ cen gci \}$ and many systems $\{ xit ong \}$ .
The establishing of a joint campaign IO command SoS should be mutually adapted to our military’s joint campaign
operational command SoS, and mutually adapted to our military’s IO weapons and equipment levels {wuqi zhuangbei
shuiping} and operational task organization {zuozhan biancheng} − to accomplish consistency of responsibilities/duties
and authority $\{ zeq uan \}$ , being elite and highly efficient $\{ jin gga nga oxi a o \}$ , and smoothness in
relationships, to ensure the agility and high efficiency $\{ lin gmi nga oxi a o \}$ and stability and reliability of IO
command. Concretely speaking, [command personnel] should follow the following several principles:

# I. The principle of being affected [driven] by needs {xuqiu qiandong}…124

Being affected by needs means establishing the joint campaign IO command SoS based on the actual needs and requirements
of IO. The needs of the joint campaign IO SoS are embodied in two respects. First is focusing on the integrated-whole
quality {zhengtixing} of the joint campaign, and establishing a SoS which fully complements {peitao} the joint campaign
command SoS. The establishment of the joint campaign IO SoS must be subordinate to and in the service of the needs and
requirements of joint campaign operations. Second is focusing on the special quality of IO, [end of page 124] and
establishing an IO command SoS mutually consistent with IO command needs. IO command has the characteristics {tedian} of
a broad distribution of the objects of command {zhihui duixiang}, stringent requirements on command time limits, and
diversification of command modes. Its command activity per se already has exceeded the scope of the traditional joint
campaign battlefield, the time limits of the command process must be those of near-real time or rapid reaction, and the
command modes are assuming the features {tezheng} of multiple avenues and diversification. Hence, only when the joint
campaign IO command SoS has been adapted to these characteristics of IO command can it meet the needs and requirements
of IO command.

# II. The principle of consistency in responsibilities/duties and authority…125

The hierarchical setup $\{ cen gci she zhi \}$ of the joint campaign IO command institutions must be rational, and the
responsibilities assumed by the institutions at all levels must be consistent with the authority {权力 quanli} they
possess. Either too many or too few levels could break the balanced status $\{ zhu ang tai \}$ of consistent
responsibilities/duties and authority, and does not benefit high-efficiency, adjustedcoordinated C2 {zhihui yu kongzhi}.
The operational procedures {yunzuo chengxu} for joint campaign IO command relationships must be clear-cut, and the
command relationships among all essential factors $\{ \nu aos u \}$ must be adjusted-coordinated consistently, to avoid
the phenomena of institutional overlap and multi-headed command, leading to the IO strengths not knowing what course to
take {无所适从 wusuo shicong}.

# III. The principle of being elite and highly efficient…125

The wide-ranging application of command automation means {zidonghua zhihui shouduan} has caused reductions in the scale
of joint campaign command institutions and boosts in effectiveness, and the establishment of IO command institutions
also should involve an elite [quality] and high efficiency. This is because of the following: first is that digitized
information display facilities equipment {shuzihua xinxi xianshi shebei} has realized real-time display of the IO
situation and of the battlefield information environment. Second is that the establishment of advanced IO command
computer-aided decision-making databases {fuzhu juece shujuku} enables large savings on human labor and manual work $\{
sho ugo ngz uoy e \}$ . Third is that advanced information transmission facilities equipment has provided reliable
information transmission assisting support {zhiyuan} for IO command activity. Hence, the joint campaign IO command
institutions can reduce the organized and allocated {bianpei} numbers of staff officers $\{ can mou \}$ and support
personnel, to meet the requirement for being elite and highly efficient.

# IV. The principle of subordination to the integrated whole…125

First, the joint campaign IO command system $\{ tiz h i \}$ also is an important component of the joint campaign command
system $\{ tiz h i \}$ . [end of page 125] In terms relative to the joint campaign command system, the IO command system
is a part; and it is present within the integrated whole of our military’s joint campaign command system. The
establishing of a scientific and rational IO command SoS must be subordinate to and in the service of the joint campaign
command system. Next, joint campaign IO is part of the entirety of joint campaign operations, and its ultimate goal is
to realize the joint campaign’s general objectives. This then requires that IO activities must be subordinate to and
comply with the needs and requirements of the integrated whole of joint campaign operations. Finally, the bringing into
play of the operational integrated-whole strength to a very great extent is dependent on the tight combination {jinmi
jiehe} of IO activities and other operational activities, as well as on the consistent adjusting-coordination among the
two main bodies, attack and defense, of IO. In other words, it is dependent on a high degree of centralization and
unification in command. But in order to realize centralized unified command, [commanders] must give full assurance in
terms of the command system $\{ tiz h i \}$ . Hence, when establishing the joint campaign IO command SoS, they must
properly handle the relationship between the integrated whole and the part. In all respects, the command institution
setup, the specification of duties and authority limits, and the establishment of command relationships. [this SoS] must be subordinate to this integrated whole of our
military’s joint campaign command system.

# V. The principle of technical restrictions…126

The joint campaign IO command SoS has direct and necessary ties to the IO weapons and equipment technical levels and to
the information warfare [IW] task organization {xinxizhan biancheng}. From the macroscopic viewpoint, the IO weapons and
equipment technical levels determine the structure and types of the IO command system; this is the specific embodiment
of this law of war $\{ zha nzh eng gui lyu \}$ , that military technology determines the armed forces system and
organizational structure {jundui tizhi bianzhi} and strategy and tactics $\{ zha nlu e \ zha nsh u \}$ , within the IO
command system. From the microscopic {weiguan} viewpoint, the specific task organization of the IO strengths determines
the specific structure of the command SoS. From the viewpoint of the trend of development, following on the boosts in
the armed forces’ informationized levels and the large-quantity employment of IO weapons, on the future digitized
battlefield, battlefield information networks will be linked into an organic whole $\{ yit i \}$ up to the supreme
command authority {zuigao zhihui dangju} and down to individuals $\{ dan bin g \}$ , and will inevitably make the
command system develop in the direction of network integration $\{ wan glu oyi tih u a \}$ . This type of integrated
operational command system will enable commanders to directly command the subordinate operational units at any level,
and even directly command individuals. Hence, only when the joint campaign [end of page 126] IO command SoS is mutually
adapted to the IO weapons and equipment technical levels and unit task organization can the entire command system
smoothly operate {yunxing}. Otherwise, it could cause command loss of control {shikong} or low efficiency of command.

# Section 3: Establishment of the Joint Campaign IO Command SoS…127

Establishing an IO command tixi system suited for IO command within a joint campaign ensures the implementation of
effective command towards IO activities, allows for forming an integrated whole for IO activities, and is an important
prerequisite for closely complementing other operational activities. Consequently, in the preparations phase of joint
campaign IO, after the joint campaign commander receives and accepts the campaign tasking $\{ ren w u \}$ , the first
job is to establish a IO command tixi system suited for joint campaign IO.

# I. Command institutions…127

Within joint campaigns, the IO command institution is the JCC’s staff team $\{ can mou \ ban z i \}$ for employment of
the IO strengths; it is an organic component of the entire joint campaign command institution; and it is the core
institution for formulating campaign IO plans {jihua}, for adjusting-coordinating the IO strengths, for
operationsresearch-based planning of IO activities, and for commanding the IO strengths within the task organization of
the campaign {zhanyi biancheng}. Under the usual circumstances, the IO command institution should be simultaneously
established with the entire joint campaign command institution.

The establishment of the IO command institution usually has two forms {形式 xingshi}: first is the establishment of a
tri-level command institution, i.e., a 3-level command institution composed of the joint campaign command’s IO
department {lianhe zhanyi zhihuibu xinxi zuozhan bumen}, the IO departments of the various services’ and arms’
operational group commands {zuozhan jituan zhihuibu}, and the IO unit command posts {budui zhihui suo} (see Figure 7.1).
Second is establishment of a bi-level command institution. This is a 2-level command institution composed of the joint
campaign command’s IO department and the various services’ and arms’ IO unit [end of page 127] command posts (see Figure
7.2).

[Image: Missing image]
Figure 7.1: Schematic of Joint Campaign IO Tri-level Command SoS

[Image: Missing image]
Figure 7.2: Schematic of Joint Campaign IO Bi-level Command SoS [end of page 128]

The internal organizational grouping $\{ nei bub ian z u \}$ of the joint campaign IO department can adopt different
models $\{ mos h i \}$ , mainly including the following two:

In the first model, the joint campaign IO department is composed of a comprehensive planning team {zonghe jihua zu}, IO
reconnaissance team {zhencha zu}, information offense team, information defense team, and comprehensive support team.
(See Figure 7.3.)

[Image: Missing image]
Fig. 7.3: One Schematic for Joint Campaign Command’s IO Department Organizational Grouping

This construction model is one put forth on the basis of systems integration thought {xitong jicheng sixiang} for joint
operations, and is a relatively ideal, fairly highlevel construction model. In this type of construction model, the
establishment of a comprehensive planning and adjusting-coordination team is in order to unify the work of
adjusting-coordination among the IO center’s various small teams $\{ xia ozu \}$ ; to make it easy for the information
offense, information defense, and information support activities to achieve consistent adjusting-coordination; and to be
beneficial to realizing integrated command of IO. The establishment of the comprehensive support team is in order to
unify the planning and organizing of IO support, and has reflected the characteristics of the high degree of reliance of
IO on high-tech support. The establishment of the three professional teams $\{ zhu any ezu \}$ , the IO reconnaissance
team, the information offense team, and the information defense team, adopts an organizational grouping method which
classifies IO according to type, has centralized command by a specialized department $\{ gui kou zhi hui \}$ , employs
systems integration, and has a high degree of jointness {lianhe}. [end of page 129] The IO reconnaissance team and
information offense team concentrate in the same place all of the strengths for the IO reconnaissance and information
offense missions undertaken by the various services and arms. They have unified operations-research-based planning and
command, so that they are tightly connected, complement one another, and to the maximum extent bring into play
integrated-whole capability $\{ zhe ngt ine ngl i \}$ , to conduct integrated reconnaissance against enemy information
systems, and to conduct IO activities such as destruction of enemy entities $\{ shi t i \}$ , electronic attack {dianzi
jingong}, psychological attack {xinli jingong}, computer network attack [CNA] {jisuanji wangluo jingong}, and special
forces assault {tezhong budui tuji} on enemy IO systems. The information defense team will unify the operations-research-based planning and command of all IO strengths to carry out information defense, including
commanding resistance to the enemy’s entity destruction, and implementation of IO activities such as electronic defense
and protection $\{ dia nzi fan gyu yuf ang h u \}$ , INFOSEC secrecy, psychological protection, and defense and
protection of computers and their network systems.

The duties of the various positions $\{ buw e i \}$ internal to the first type of organizational grouping model are as
follows:

The comprehensive planning team is composed of staff personnel having intimate knowledge of Army, Navy, Air Force, and
Second Artillery Corps IO. Its main duties are operations-research-based planning of IO activities, and drafting $\{ niz
h i \}$ of unified IO plans; responsibility for reporting (to higher levels) and transmission {shangbao yu chuanda} of
various types of messages {wendian} and plans; based on the joint campaign senior officer’s {shouzhang} requirements and
IO plans, the adjustingcoordination and control of the IO units’ operational activities; and, based on needs and
requirements, the adjusting-coordination of IO and other operational activities, as well as of information offense and
information defense activities.

The IO reconnaissance team is composed of staff personnel having intimate knowledge of all services’ and arms’ EW
reconnaissance {dianzi duikang zhencha} and computer network reconnaissance. Its duties are the formulation of IO
reconnaissance plans, and the command and adjusting-coordination of the IO reconnaissance activities of all services and
arms.

The information offense team is composed of staff personnel having intimate knowledge of all services’ and arms’ IO. Its
main duties are formulation of information offense and information deception {xinxi qipian} activities plans, and
command of the information offense activities of all services and arms.

The information defense team is composed of staff personnel having intimate knowledge of all services’ and arms’
communication [countermeasures] and EW {tongxin, dianzi duikang}. Its main duties are formulation of information defense
plans for electronic counter-jamming {dianzi fanganrao} and electronic camouflage {dianzi weizhuang}, and for defending
against enemy precision-guided munition [PGM] {jingque zhidao wuqi} attacks, and adjusting-coordinating and guiding all
units within the operational task organization [end of page 130] in conducting information defense.

The comprehensive support team is composed of personnel from the communication, computer, command automation, and
equipment technology departments of all services and arms. Its main duties are formulation of IO materiel $\{ wuz i \}$
and equipment technical support plans, adjusting-coordination and allocation and transfer $\{$ {调 拨 diaobo} of IO
weapons and equipment and command automation and network facilities equipment, and adjusting-coordination of maintenance
$\{ wei xiu \}$ and support for all types of IO weapons and equipment.

In the second model, the joint campaign IO department is composed of a comprehensive planning team, entity destruction
control team, EW {dianzizhan} team, network warfare {wangluozhan} team, INFOSEC support team, psychological warfare
[PSYWAR] {xinlizhan} team, and comprehensive support team. (See Figure 7.4.)

[Image: Missing image]
Fig. 7.4: Second Schematic, Joint Campaign Command’s IO Department zational Grouping

This model is one established based on our military’s existing IO strengths. Besides the comprehensive planning and
adjusting-coordination team and the comprehensive support team, whose roles are the same as in the first model, its
organization includes an entity destruction control team, EW team, and PSYWAR team, all of which already have a command
organization within the existing command institutions. Some of them, even though {jinguan} they currently still lack
clear-cut centralized organization in a special department $\{ gui kou zuz h i \}$ , nonetheless there still are other
command organizations which act on their behalf {daixing} to perform their duties. This is beneficial to rapidly
establishing an IO center and rapidly forming command capability. This model also adds an INFOSEC [end of page 131]
support team and network warfare team, whose aim is to lay stress on the position and role of IO activities such as
computer network warfare [CNW] and INFOSEC secrecy within modern IO. This construction model has a fairly clear-cut
division of labor, makes it easy to perform command duties, and is relatively suited to the reality of our military’s
present IO command and practice still being in an initial phase.

The main duties of the various positions internal to the second organizational grouping are as follows:

The duties of the comprehensive planning team and comprehensive support team are the same as in the organizational
grouping in the first model.

The entity destruction control team is composed of personnel having intimate knowledge of the operations of the Second
Artillery Corps, naval bombing aviation forces {haijun hongzha hangkongbing} and ground attack aviation forces {qiangji
hangkongbing}, Army aviation forces {lujun hangkongbing}, and special forces, as well as operations with PGMs. Its main
duties are drafting of operational plans for effecting hard destruction of enemy information systems and informationized
weapons and equipment, and complementing the joint campaign command center in adjustingcoordinating the units (elements)
{bu (fen) dui} undertaking the hard-destruction missions in carrying out entity destruction operations.

The EW team is composed of staff personnel having intimate knowledge of the EW strengths and employment requirements of
the various services and arms, including those of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps. Its main duties
are collection and processing of EW intelligence; putting forth EW resolution recommendations {juexin jianyi}; drafting
of EW operational plans; transmission of EW operational orders and instructions $\{ \boldsymbol { z } his h i \}$ ;
organization of EW coordination and its various types of support; supervising-promoting $\{ duc u \}$ , inspection
{jiancha} and reporting (to higher levels) of the operational preparations and implementation situation for campaign EW;
and timely handling of problems arising during the EW implementation process.

The network warfare team is composed of related staff officers and technical personnel having intimate knowledge of
communication, command automation, and computer networks. Its main duties are drafting of networking plans {zuwang
jihua} for battlefield information transmission systems and command systems, and of information support plans; drafting
of defense plans for computer systems, battlefield information network systems, and command information systems; guiding
and adjusting-coordinating the IO strengths in conducting network operations; and carrying out maintenance $\{ wei h u
\}$ of informationized battlefield network systems.

The INFOSEC support team is composed of staff personnel for technical security secrecy {jishu anquan baomi},
communication, and cryptography {jiyao}. Its main duties are drafting of INFOSEC support plans, transmission of INFOSEC
[end of page 132] support instructions and taking responsibility for information secrecy work, and, in a unified manner,
carrying out battlefield EM spectrum management {dianci pinpu guanzhi} and cryptographic management {mima guanli}.

The PSYWAR team is composed of political work personnel and related personnel from PSYWAR units. Its main duties are
unified drafting of PSYWAR plans, including those for wartime news control $\{ xin wen gua nzh i \}$ , and of
operational activities plans with psychological deterrence {xinli weishe} as the goal, and guidance of the units’ PSYWAR
activities.

Within specific operations, the model which the IO department finally adopts should be determined based on our
military’s operational training levels {zuozhan xunlian shuiping}, the degree of development of information weapons and
equipment, and the JCC’s related instructions and requirements. However, no matter which model is adopted, it always
should clarify its basic missions and duties, and the personnel composition always should be scientific and rational.

# II. Basic duties…133

The IO department, according to the JCC’s resolution and intent, and under direct leadership by the head of the C2
center {指控中心 zhikong zhongxin}, performs the following duties: first is organizing of the joint campaign IO
reconnaissance, and grasping of the IO-related situation. Second is putting forth of the joint campaign’s IO reports and
resolution recommendations. Third is organizing and drafting of IO plans. Fourth is receiving and execution of the
higher-level IO orders and instructions, and briefing $\{ ton gba o \}$ of the IO situation to the lower levels. Fifth
is organizing and adjusting-coordinating the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps IO strengths within the
task organization of campaign in conducting IO reconnaissance, information offense, and information defense against the
enemy. Sixth is organizing of IO coordination and professional support. Seventh is supervising-promoting and inspection
of the lower levels’ preparations for IO. Eighth is commanding and adjustingcoordinating all IO activities, and timely
analysis and resolution of problems arising during the IO implementation process. Ninth is fulfilling other correlated
missions $\{ xia ngg uan ren w u \}$ entrusted by the JCC.

The IO departments of the various services’ and arms’ campaign large formations {zhanyi juntuan}, within the scope of
their corresponding responsibilities and authority, perform functions {zhineng} similar to those of the joint campaign
command’s {联指 lianzhi} IO department. What is different is that the IO department of the joint command’s C2 center is
responsible for IO command within the entire campaign scope, [end of page 133] and lays particular emphasis on
integrated-whole working out an approach in planning {zhengti mouhua} and on the guiding and adjusting-coordination
work. By contrast, the IO departments of the various services and arms center on the joint campaign IO missions, and lay
particular emphasis on the specific command of the IO activities of their root services and arms.

# III. Command relationships…134

The joint campaign’s participating {canzhan} IO strengths are numerous, and their missions complex. The command
relationships for IO should, according to the requirements for being clear-cut, direct, convenient, smooth, and highly
efficient, and based on the realities of the campaign, determine the command relationships, the attached relationships
$\{ pei shu gua nxi \}$ , the coordination and assisting support (safeguarding support) relationships {xietong yu
zhiyuan (baozhang) guanxi}, and the guidance relationships. The joint campaign IO department, under the specific
leadership by and intent of the chief of staff {canmouzhang} and the head of the C2 center, launches {kaizhan} the work,
puts into effect unified organization and planning of IO activities, and guides the operational activities of the IO
units (elements). The IO group (grouping) command {jituan (qun) zhihuibu} directly commands the operational activities of the subordinate IO units (elements).

The command relationships include the command relationships composed by the joint campaign command over the IO groups
(groupings), by the IO group (grouping) commands over the subordinate IO units, and by the service and arm operational
group commands over the subordinate IO units.

The attached relationship signifies the relationship formed between two units {danwei} when the JCC, in order to
strengthen the operational capability {zuozhan nengli} of the IO units, temporarily allocates and transfers $\{ lin shi
dia obo \}$ some forcestrengths back to the use of the IO units. After such an attached relationship is established, the
IO unit commanders and their command organs {zhihui jiguan} implement all-around command and support of the operational
activities of the attached unit(s). After an attached unit fulfills the predetermined mission(s), it can per orders
return to its organizational system {归建 guijian}, and the attached relationship is correspondingly dissolved.

The coordination and assisting support relationship. Coordination and assisting support relationships can be clarified
among all operational groups (task groups {jiqun}), among the IO units of all operational groups (task groups), between
the IO units of different operational groups (task groups), and among the internal [parts] of the IO units subordinate
to all groups (task groups), based on the differences in the IO missions and operational activities. [end of page 134]

Guidance relationships: guidance relationships are composed by the joint campaign command’s IO department over the IO
departments of all operational group (task group) commands, and by the IO departments of all service and arm operational
group commands over subordinate IO unit command posts.

# Section 4: Several Issues Which Should Be Grasped in Establishing the Joint Campaign IO Command SoS…135

The establishing of a joint campaign IO command SoS not only is one of the needs and requirements for propelling IO
building, but also is one of the needs and requirements for boosting the real combat capability for IO. Hence, [command
personnel] must occupy the high ground of the times, combine [the needs and requirements] with reality, focus on
development, and actively and reliably carry out [this task].

# I. Changing concepts {guannian}, expanding new viewing fields for establishing the joint campaign IO command SoS…135

Establishing the joint campaign IO command SoS requires changing three concepts. First is changing the concept that the
JCC takes on all {包揽 baolan} IO command authority $\{ zhi hui \ qua n \}$ . Some viewpoints hold that joint campaign IO
command authority should be directly held by the JCC, and there is no necessity for then establishing a joint campaign
IO command institution. In reality, for the JCC to completely assume the IO command mission could lead to dispersal
{fensan} of the JCC’s energy, and to weakening of his command and of his capability for controlling {jiayu} the overall
situation of the joint campaign. Second is changing the concept that IO command authority can be taken on {daixing} by
the IO work [service] functional departments {yewu zhineng bumen}. Some viewpoints hold that the intelligence,
communication, and EW {dianzi duikang} departments within the joint campaign command institution all have their
respective objects of command within IO, and that IO command authority can be taken on by these work functional
departments. However, in fact the main energies of these work departments will be focused on processing their respective
work, [end of page 135] making it difficult for them to also give consideration to the overall situation of IO. If the
various work functional departments are made to serve as the joint campaign IO command institution, that inevitably will
decentralize the IO command authority limits, and thus lead to chaos in the IO activities. Third is changing the concept
that the functions of a joint campaign IO command institution [can be] taken on by a certain work department. In
reality, any one functional department within the IO command institution never has the authority {quanwei} for
commanding IO. The exercise of IO command authority by a certain functional department clearly would violate the law of
objective quality $\{ keg uan xin g \}$ in terms of the functional partitioning {zhineng huafen} of the joint campaign
IO command institution, and is something which cannot be established. Hence, study of joint campaign IO command issues
must further expand the viewing field.

# II. Strengthening legislation, seeing that the establishment of the joint campaign IO command SoS moves onto the new track of advancement according to law {yifa tuijin}…136

At the present time, among important operational rules {zuozhan fagui}, such as the Chinese People’s Liberation Army
[CPLA] Joint Campaign Guidelines {lianhe zhanyi gangyao}, even though standards [norms] {guifan} have been laid out for
establishing an IO department within a joint campaign command institution, nonetheless the position and role of the
joint campaign IO command SoS within the joint campaign command SoS still have not been clarified, and issues such as
the internal setup {neibu shezhi} and functional differentiation {zhineng qufen} of the joint campaign IO command
institution have still not been standardized [normalized]. From the viewpoint of establishing needs for the joint
campaign IO command SoS, there is a necessity when revising {xiuding} the related operational laws to correspondingly
increase the content of IO command SoS building, and, via exercises $\{ yan x i \}$ , to test {jianyan} the different
command modes and efficiencies $\{ xia oly u \}$ of the professional and nonprofessional IO strengths; then to gradually
elevate them to the level of the joint campaign; and finally to implement them within joint campaigns. By strengthening
the legislation, [we] ensure that the establishment of the joint campaign IO command institution has laws to abide by
{有法可依 youfa keyi} and has rules to follow {有章可循 youzhang kexun}.

# III. Being bold in practice, exploring new laws for establishing the joint campaign IO command SoS…136

First is the need to carry out testing {jianyan} of the envisioned {shexiang} joint campaign IO command institution
within joint campaign exercises. When organizing joint campaign exercises, [the commander] can, in a manner having a
directed [focused] quality {you zhenduixing di}, [end of page 136] set up an IO command institution; allow all levels to
discover problems by operation $\{ yun zuo \}$ of the IO command institution; and, via practice, explore measures for
resolving the problems, and seek the optimal avenue for establishing the joint campaign IO command SoS. Second is that,
within the practice of joint campaign IO command SoS building, [the commander] must focus on development; persevere in a
mutual combination of theoretical research and experience in practice; constantly strengthen research on IO command
theory; deepen the understanding of IO command laws; and perfect a theory SoS [body of theory] {lilun tixi} conforming
to our military’s reality, and complying with the IO command principles, command system $\{ tiz h i \}$ , and command
modes needed and required for future operations. Third is the need to go through practice to verify {yanzheng} and
perfect the joint campaign IO theory, and to use scientific theory to guide practice in joint campaign IO command
institution building, and to maintain a scientific quality $\{ kex uex ing \}$ in the structure of the joint campaign
information operations command system of systems. [end of page 137; end of chapter]

# Chapter 8 Joint Campaign Information Operations Preparations…138

Information operations [IO] preparations are the series of organizing and leadership activities conducted in advance in
order to implement IO by the joint campaign commander and his command organ in accordance with the joint campaign
intention. For IO preparations, one should meticulously perform operations researchbased planning and thoroughly
organize it on the basis of the peacetime preparations and in accordance with higher level intent and the objective
realities of both sides. IO preparations normally include: organize readiness grade transitions; establish the IO
command institution and clarify command relationships; receive the tasks and set down the IO resolution; issue IO tasks;
formulate the IO plan; organize IO coordination; organize IO support and wartime political work; organize IO unit
unfolding; organize and implement imminent battle training and supervise operational preparations. During a joint
campaign, IO preparations are an important component of the entirety of campaign preparations. Thoroughly and
successfully accomplishing each item of preparations work in IO not only is an important responsibility of the joint
campaign commander and his command organ, but it also a prerequisite and foundation for smoothly implementing IO
activities.

# Section 1: Organize Readiness Grade Transitions…138

Readiness grade transitions normally refer to transitioning from a daily readiness {jingchangxing} to a higher grade
readiness or from a daily readiness grade by skipping grades directly to the necessary readiness grade. The joint [end
of page 138] campaign command organ should, in accordance with higher level orders and instructions, issue readiness
grade transition orders to participating IO units at the right time and strictly organize readiness grade transitions.
Under the guidance of the joint campaign command headquarters $\{ zhi hui b u \}$ , IO units should successfully
accomplish the following work when organizing readiness grade transitions:

Receive the joint command readiness grade transition order and instruction; combining it with the IO missions, relay the
readiness grade transition orders; and issue the readiness grade transition advance order to subordinate units.

Revise and improve the maneuver {jidong}, expansion of task-organization {kuobian}, air defense {fangkong} and
operational $\{ zuo zha n \}$ readiness courses of action {zhanbei fang’an}.

Convene Party committee (operations) meeting; issue the higher level readiness grade transition order; and perform
dispositioning of one’s own level readiness grade transition work.

 Issue readiness grade transition order to the units. The readiness transition order contents mainly include: brief on
the enemy situation; tasks that units are about to execute; readiness grade transition scale; the main work and time
limits for completing readiness grade transitions; and requirements of each item of preparations work, etc. The
readiness grade transition order should be prompt, brief and concise and secret, and it does not involve the higher
level’s general operational intention and the specific time of operational start. The time limit for completing
readiness grade transition is normally stipulated correspondingly on the basis of the readiness grade and unit types.

Organize readiness duty schedules $\{ zha nbe izh iba n \}$ . This includes senior officer duty schedules, operations
duty schedules and department duty schedules {yewu bumen zhiban}. Duty personnel should supervise-urge each IO unit to
successfully accomplish each item of preparation work in accordance with different readiness requirements.

Supervise-urge, inspect and guide unit readiness grade transitions. After the readiness transition order is issued, the
IO commander and his command organ should conduct inspections, assistance and guidance for the mobilization preparation
work situation of their subordinate units so as to ensure implementation of the readiness grade transition work. The
main content of inspections are: understanding the higher level orders and instructions and execution situation;
mobilization and thought education situations; repair and adjusting-replenishment [end of page 139] situation of weapons
and equipment; and the implementation situation of each item of readiness zhidu system such as that of the readiness
on-duty personnel.

Higher level readiness grade transition situation. After accomplishing a readiness grade transition or on the basis of
higher level requirements, one should promptly report up the readiness grade transition synthesized situation. The
report contents mainly include: comprehension of higher level orders and instructions and their execution situation;
readiness duty personnel situation; unit thought status and gathering of personnel situations; readiness courses of
actions revisions and inspection-repair and adjustment of replenishment of weapons and equipment situations, etc.

 Readiness grade transition times are tight, contents are many and requirements are high, so the commander and his
command organ should perform unified operations research-based planning, meticulously organize and ensure that readiness
grade transitions are accomplished within the stipulated time limits.

# Section 2: Receiving the Tasks, Setting the Information Operations Resolution…140

# I. Receiving the tasks…140

The joint campaign commander, normally through a modes such as participating in an operational meeting or receiving
higher level verbal or written operational order, receives the IO tasks at the same time as receiving the general
operational tasks. The joint campaign commander ordinarily does not singularly receive the IO tasks, but in a special
situation, he may only receive the IO tasks.

The joint campaign commander, when he receives the IO tasks, should be clear on the higher level general operational
intention, the higher level’s IO intention as well as the issues he should pay attention to with key points in
implementing that operational intention; the explicit IO tasks that higher level’s have given to his level and the basic
requirements for accomplishing the IO tasks; the IO tasks of the other directions and the effects of accomplishing the
IO tasks at his level.

After the joint campaign commander receives the tasks, he should quickly relay it to the command organ the following:
the enemy situation and higher level intent $\{ yit u \}$ ; the IO tasks of their own level; [end of page 140] friendly
situation; operational requirements and limiting conditions. After relaying the tasks, they should, on the basis of the
total time for campaign preparations, scientifically plan and arrange each item of work in the campaign preparations
phase, and instruct the IO departments to quickly formulate the work plan of the campaign preparations phase and prepare
the relevant materials and IO synthesized resolution report recommendation {zonghe juexin baogao jianyi}; they should
instruct the political work department, logistic support department and equipment support department to separately and
quickly unfold their corresponding preparation work.

# II. Setting the IO resolution…141

The IO resolution {xinxi zuozhan juexin} is the basic decision {jueding} accomplished by the joint campaign commander
for IO activities; it is the basis for formulating the joint campaign IO plan, issuing IO orders and organizing IO
coordination. During joint campaign operations, the IO resolution is an important component of the entire joint campaign
resolution, so serving as a part of the campaign resolution is reflected in the entire campaign resolution. Setting the
IO resolution is conducted on the basis of the sequence of comprehending the tasks; assessing the situations;
determining the IO intention; dividing the tasks; clarifying the command, coordination and support items; listening to
the reports and recommendations and determining the IO resolution.

# (1) Comprehending the tasks

After receiving the IO tasks, the joint campaign commander should completely and accurately comprehend the tasks. This
includes: comprehending the higher level intent, operational concept, main direction, operational disposition,
differentiation of operational phases and the operational tasks of each phase; clarifying the relationships between IO
activities and other operational activities; getting clear the nature of IO tasks, the goal and requirements to be
reached and the position and role of IO in the overall situation of the campaign, etc.

(2) Assessing the situations

Assessing the battlefield IO situation is the prerequisite condition of setting the IO resolution. On the basis of fully
understanding the IO tasks, the joint campaign commander should guide his relevant departments (such as IO,
intelligence, communications, etc.), and on the basis of [end of page 141] completely analyzing and assessing the IO of
both sides and the battlefield posture, set the correct IO resolution. Normally, the IO resolution an important content
of the joint campaign commander’s operational resolution and it is determined at the same time as the joint campaign
commander sets the operational resolution. The IO resolution normally includes the following:

1. Enemy situation assessment

This mainly includes the following four areas:

The enemy’s main commander’s situation: mainly analyzing and assessing the situations such as the enemy commander’s
command characteristics and personality, the importance he attaches to information, information technology and IO
application, and experience in implementing IO.

The enemy’s information infrastructure and information systems: mainly analyzing and assessing the structure,
distribution and necessary technical parameters of the enemy’s information infrastructure; the critical information
nodes or links in the information infrastructure; the degree of reliance on the information infrastructure; the
locations of other infrastructure the information infrastructure must rely on; their capability to restore the important
information infrastructure that is disrupted; their capability to handle the disruption of their information systems;
the composition and deployment of the campaign command information system, especially the important parts such as the
critical nodes.

The enemy’s IO capability: mainly analyzing and assessing the enemy’s IO intention; IO reconnaissance capability,
information attack capability, information defense capability; the main direction for implementing IO, the IO strength
taskorganization and disposition; the means and patterns they may implement information attack against us; the modes and
capabilities that international influence may have on the enemy conducting IO support {zhiyuan}.

The weak points of the enemy’s information systems: mainly analyzing and assessing the weak links of the enemy’s air
defense anti-missiles, intelligence and reconnaissance, command and control, communication and satellite navigation
systems, finding out approaches {duice} to utilize their weak points, and analyzing any supplemental disruptions that
may result from implementing IO against the enemy. [End of page 142]

# 2. Our situation assessment

This mainly includes: the military-government quality, operational capability and degree of readiness of IO units within
the joint campaign task-organization; IO reconnaissance capability, information attack capability, information defense
capability, electromagnetic spectrum management and control capability; the capability of commanders at each level to
organize command and coordination of IO.

# 3. Battlefield environment assessment

Mainly, ascertain the natural environment, social environment and electromagnetic environment of the operational area.

For the natural environment, this includes: the terrain characteristics of the operational area, in particular the
effects of the direction of roads, valleys and mountain massifs and forest distribution on IO activities; the areas that
are favorable for maneuvering and concealing the deployment of IO force strengths and weaponry; the flyby times,
position fixes and operating orbits of various enemy reconnaissance satellites in the operations area; the distribution
and operating situation of our command information systems in the operations area.

For the social environment, this includes: situations in the operations areas such as social, economic, cultural, ethnic
religions and people’s psychology; the support {zhiyuan} and support {baozhang} capabilities of local civilian
information infrastructure on IO; the manpower and materials strength situation that the government can support
{zhiyuan} IO.

For the electromagnetic environment, this includes: the situation of civilian electronic equipment distribution,
television, radio and communication frequency spectrums and other electromagnetic emissions; the situations of the
enemy’s electronic interference equipment distribution and electronic jamming and the degree of influence on our
operational activities.

4. Reaching a conclusion of the situation assessment

On the basis of analyzing and assessing the enemy situation, our situation and the battlefield situation, clarify the
strong and weak points of the enemy information targets and the total capabilities of our IO operations as well as the
degree of task completion.

(3) Determining the IO intention

The IO intention is the basic conceptualization made by the joint campaign commander on how to carry out IO on the basis
of comprehending the tasks and assessing the situations, [end of page 143] and it is an important step in setting the IO
resolution. The content of the IO intention mainly includes: operational goal, operational targets, strength
application, basic fighting methods, etc. After the IO intention is determined, quickly issue towards subordinates, and
simultaneously clarify the times, sequence, content and methods for listening to reports and recommendations.

(4) Differentiating tasks, clarifying command, coordination and support items

Differentiating tasks is the task whereby the joint campaign commander preliminarily divides the IO units under his
direct subordination and each service or arm. The joint campaign commander should, on the basis of earnestly
understanding and grasping the operational capabilities of each participating IO unit and centering on the campaign
intention, preliminarily determine the IO tasks of each service or arm operations group {zuozhan jituan} for the IO
group {jituan} (grouping {qun}).

In clarifying command, coordination and support items, one mainly clarifies the following: the set-up location of the IO
group’s (grouping’s) command post and the time for completing set-up and the time limit and requirements for
establishing the information system[s]; IO coordination key points, coordination relationships and coordination forms
and methods; the operational support, logistic support and equipment support key points of IO.

After differentiating tasks, and clarifying command, coordination and support items, one should promptly issue the
operational advance order {zuozhan yuxian haoling} so as to allow the IO group (grouping) and the operations group IO
units of each service or arm to conduct IO preparations as early as possible. The content of this is mainly: to
preliminarily clarify the tasks, preparation work and completion time limit of the IO units of the IO group (grouping)
or each service or arm as well as the items such as command, coordination and support.

# (5) Listening to reports and recommendations

During the course of setting the IO resolution, one should listen to the IO reports and recommendations so as to allow
the resolution to conform more to objective realities and to make the correct decision. Under ordinary situations, [end
of page 144] one only listens to the synthesized report and recommendation put forth by his chief of staff; under
special situations, one can separately listen to the reports and recommendations of his IO departments and IO unit
commanders. Outside of this, depending on needs-requirements, one can consult relevant personnel of the IO departments
at the appropriate times on the situations.

The IO reports and recommendations main contents include: situation assessment conclusions; the IO intention; the IO
main direction and key point targets; the IO disposition; IO fighting methods; the times for completing operational
preparations and initiating information attacks; and organizing of IO command.

# (6) Determining the IO resolution

In determining the IO resolution, one normally should make the decision on the basis of correctly comprehending the IO
tasks, completely understanding and grasping the enemy situation, our situation and battlefield situation, and listening
to the IO situation reports and recommendations. The main contents include: IO intention; main operational direction and
key point targets; IO disposition; fighting methods; times for completing IO preparations and initiating IO; and items
of IO command and coordination.

# 1. Determining the IO goal

The IO goal is the anticipated outcome and goal to be reached in joint campaign IO. The joint campaign IO commander
should correctly determine the Io goal based on the joint campaign intention, enemy situation, PLA IO capabilities,
battlefield electromagnetic environment, etc. The IO goal can be implementing information attack and seizing and
maintaining battlefield information dominance; [it can be] implementing information defense and ensuring our operational
information security and a normal bringing into play of our information system effectiveness; [it can be] implementing
IO reconnaissance and gathering the needed intelligence for joint campaign IO.

2. Determining the IO main direction and key point targets

The main direction of IO is the direction and areas/zones $\{ quy u \}$ for concentrating IO strengths and IO weaponry
so as to implement the main information attack and seize information dominance against the enemy. [End of page 145]
During a joint campaign, the main direction of IO in the majority of situations should be identical to the main
direction of the campaign, but in different phases of the campaign, due to the specific goals of IO being different, the
main direction of IO will change accordingly. One should select it on the basis of factors such as the joint campaign
goal, main operational direction, the deployment of the enemy’s information systems, etc. In determining the main
direction of IO, one should be able to effectively support {zhiyuan} and support {baozhang} the operational activities
in the main direction; and one should be able to effectively paralyze the enemy’s information systems and destroy the
important information targets.

The key point targets of IO are the enemy’s important information targets that are selected with key points in order to
seize (partial) information dominance. When determining key point targets of IO, one should select the critical nodes
{guanjian jiedian} in the enemy’s information systems having a significant effect on the operational activities of the
various phases (time occasions). When determining the key point strike targets of IO, not only must one clarify specific
directions and locations, but at the same time, one should successfully determine the priority sequence of strikes based
on the degree of importance of the target and the possible course of the campaign.

# 3. Determining the IO fighting method

IO is normally divided into two basic types of information attack and information defense. The basic fighting methods of
information attack are mainly: information deterrence {xinxi weishe}, information blockade $\{ xin xif eng suo \}$ ,
information momentum creation {xinxi zaoshi}, information pollution $\{ xin xiw ura n \}$ , and information paralysis
{xinxi tanhuan}. The basic fighting methods of information defense are mainly: information concealment $\{ xin xiy inb i
\}$ , information deception $\{ xin xiq ipi a n \}$ , information network construction {信息组网 xinxi zuwang}, and
information protective screening $\{$ 信息屏障 xinxi pingzhang}. When determining the IO fighting methods, one should
accomplish an organic adjusting-coordination $\{ you jix iet iao \}$ with other operational fighting methods, and be
mutually complementary so as to not only be beneficial for achieving the specific IO goal, but also create favorable
conditions for other operational activities; one should, at the time-opportunity and place of employment, successfully
determine the application of the IO fighting method from the perspective of the overall situation of the campaign, and
not only must this be favorable for implementing effective strikes against the enemy, but it can also avoid as much as
possible creating harmful effects for one’s own activities.

# 4. Determining the IO disposition

The IO disposition is the strength task-organizational grouping, mission differentiation and deployment conducted for
[end of page 146] various directly subordinate and attached IO strengths in accordance with the operational missions and
fighting methods and on the basis of the unified plan. The joint campaign commander and his command organ should
rationally determine the IO strength disposition on the basis of situations such as the joint campaign tasks, enemy
situation, IO capabilities, battlefield environment, etc. In determining the IO disposition, one must: rationally employ
the IO strengths, improve the degree of blending of various IO strengths, and form a stronger tixi system operational
capability so as to benefit the bringing into play of the integrated-hole effectiveness of the IO strengths of various
services and arms; in order to benefit the concentration of IO strengths in the main direction, areas and time
occasions, [one must] form a localized information confrontation superiority against the enemy; and in order to support
{zhiyuan} and complement the main campaign activities, [one must] adapt to the requirements of different operational
patterns.

The form of task-organizationally grouping the IO strength is mainly determined according to the IO tasks, requirements
and the specific situation at that time. When the joint campaign commander and his command organ are
task-organizationally grouping the IO strength, they should abide by the shared requirements of task-organizationally
grouping the IO strength, take aim at their specific situation of IO and implement a scientific, rational and flexible
task-organizational grouping. There are normally two task-organizational grouping modes:

The first is whereby the joint campaign command headquarters, in a unified manner, task-organizationally groups a large
portion of IO strengths into an IO group {jituan} (grouping {qun}), and the remainder of the IO strengths are under the
control and employment of each service and arm.

(i) IO group (grouping). This is normally task-organized from IO units attached by higher-level or directly subordinate
to the campaign as well as some IO strengths transferred {choudiao} from each service and arm. This mainly includes
electronic confrontation units, network warfare units as well as local IO strengths, etc., and these are directly
controlled and employed by the joint campaign command headquarters. One normally task-organizationally groups then into
the IO reconnaissance grouping, radar jamming grouping, communications jamming grouping, network attack grouping, early
warning aircraft confrontation grouping, satellite confrontation grouping, electronic air defense grouping and the IO
reserve force, etc. They mainly undertake the missions of seizing joint campaign (localized) information dominance and
supporting {zhiyuan} and complementing the campaign activities of other services and arms. They are normally separately
deployed in areas-zones facilitative for carrying out operational missions.

# [End of page 147]

(ii) On-land operations group IO grouping. This is normally task-organized from the IO strengths within the
military-area-command’s established structure and/or augmented by higher levels, and it is task-organizationally grouped
into a number of subgroupings based on specialty or mission. They mainly undertake on-land IO operational missions and
are separately deployed in [land] zones {diyu} facilitative for carrying out missions.

(iii) At-sea operations group IO grouping. This is normally task-organized from the IO strengths within the Navy’s
established structure, and it is task-organizationally grouped into a number of sub-groupings based on specialty or
mission. They mainly undertake at-sea and in-shore IO missions, and they are separately deployed in [land] zones $\{ diy
u \}$ facilitative for carrying out missions.

(iv) Air operations group IO grouping. This is normally task-organized from the IO strengths within the Air Force’s
established structure, and it is task-organizationally grouped as a number of sub-groupings based on specialty or
mission. They mainly undertake air and ground air defense IO missions, and they are separately deployed in [land] zones
$\{ diy u \}$ facilitative for carrying out missions.

(v) Missile operations group IO grouping. It is normally task-organized from the IO strengths within the Second
Artillery’s established structure, and it is taskorganizationally grouped into a number of sub-groupings based on
specialty and mission. They mainly undertake IO support {zhiyuan} screening missions of the Second Artillery base, and
they are separately deployed in [land] zones $\{ diy u \}$ facilitative for carrying out missions.

The second is, based on the operational mission and with the joint campaign command headquarters controlling a smaller
portion of elite IO strengths, one concentrates the task-organizational grouping into an IO task-group $\{ jiq u n \}$
and the remaining larger portion of IO strengths are attached to the operations group of each service or arm and is
under the control of the operations group of each service or arm.

5. Determining the time for completing IO preparations and the initiation time

The time limit for completing IO preparations must not only be earlier than the time limit for the other units to
complete their preparations, but one must also ensure that the IO units will have a corresponding time to complete their
operational preparations. The information attack initiation time refers to the time to concentrate and implement
information attack. In the initial phase of the campaign, the time for concentrating and implementing information attack
normally uses the [end of page 148] integrated firepower attack time {zonghe huoli tuji shijian} as a datum point, and
depending on the situation, it can be conducted before or at the same time as the integrated firepower attack.

# 6. Determining the organizing of IO command

In determining the organizing of IO command, the key points are to clarify the IO departments and the
directly-subordinate IO unit command post’s deployment location, the time and place of set-up, and the organizing mode
for communications and establishing contact during command.

# Section 3: Issuing IO Missions..149

The joint campaign command organ should, in accordance with the commander’s resolution and instructions in the aspect of
IO, quickly formulate the IO plan and issue the IO missions to the units via the form of operational orders. One must be
clear, specific and maintain secrecy when issuing IO missions.

The main content of IO orders includes: the enemy situation assessment conclusion; higher level IO intent; one’s own
level IO missions and the senior officer’s basic resolution {jiben juexin}; task organization, deployment and missions
of the IO group (grouping) and each service and arm operations group’s {zuozhan jituan} (task group’s {jiqun}) IO
grouping; the time limit for completing operational preparations and the time for IO initiation; the time and place of
IO command post set-up, etc.

When time is urgent or when concealing the operational intention, one can also issue missions with the form of
individual orders. When issuing operational missions via the form of individual orders, one ordinarily only transmits to
the relevant unit and the content is limited to just the relevant items for that unit. [End of page 149]

# Section 4: Formulating the IO Plan…150

The IO plan is the series of in-advance arrangements conducted by the joint campaign commander and his command organ in
order to guide each service and arm in implementing joint campaign IO activities. The joint campaign commander should
instruct the IO command institution to promptly, quickly and thoroughly accomplish the IO plan formulation work in
accordance with the joint campaign commander’s intent, the joint campaign activity general plan {lianhe zhanyi xingdon
zongti jihua}, the IO missions and objectives to be reached, and the task-organizational grouping of IO strengths and
mission differentiation. During a joint campaign, the chief of staff is normally in charge of the IO plan, and with the
IO departments in the lead and the personnel of relevant departments participating in plan formulation, the chief of
staff is responsible for examining and approving it.

# I. The main content of the IO plan…150

The joint campaign IO plan normally includes the joint campaign IO activities plan and the joint campaign IO support
plan.

(1) The joint campaign IO activities plan

The joint campaign IO activities plan is divided into the general plan {zongti jihua}, the sub-plans {fenzhi jihua} and
the coordination plan {xietong jihua}.

# 1. The joint campaign IO general plan

The main content of the joint campaign IO general plan normally includes: situation assessment conclusion; higher level
IO intention and one’s own level IO missions; IO strength task-organization, deployment and mission differentiation; the
partitioning of each operational phase, anticipated situations and activity courses of action; and command and
coordination items, etc. [End of page 150]

# (i) Situation assessment conclusion

This mainly clarifies: the deployment of the enemy’s information systems, keypoint target locations and main technical
parameters; defensive and protection capabilities; the enemy’s information attack capability; force strength
task-organization; operational intention; operational goal; IO means and operational methods; potential operational
activities one may adopt in each phase and each time occasion of combat.

(ii) Higher level intention and one’s own level IO missions

Higher level intention mainly clarifies: the general guidance concept {zongde zhidao fangzhen}, principles and
operational goal to be reached in the joint campaign; and higher level IO main objectives, main IO activities and
methods, key-point defense and protection targets, means and methods. The missions of one’s own level IO mainly
clarifies the following: one’s own level’s IO strength task-organization, main operational targets, operational
areas-zones and key-point targets and parts of defense and protection, etc.

(iii) IO strength task-organization, deployment and mission differentiation

This mainly clarifies: the task-organization and deployment of all subordinate services and arms IO strengths and
attached or supporting IO strengths; the missions of each service and arm IO strengths; the main direction and targets
of IO, key-points of strikes, main operational means and modes/methods, etc.; and key-points of information defense and
main means, methods and measures, etc.

(iv) Partitioning of each operational phase, anticipated situations and operational activities courses of action

The partitioning of the joint campaign IO phase is ordinarily identical to the partitioning of the joint campaign phase,
so under the premise of not conflicting with partitioning of the joint campaign phase, one can further partition into
several small operational phases based on the needs-requirements of joint campaign IO. In formulating the anticipated
situations and operational activity courses of action, one conceptualizes in-advance the battlefield situation in each
phase of IO and the main operational activities of both sides as well as clarifies the main activity courses of action
of the IO units. Furthermore, because IO is generally the first to start and last to conclude, outside of partitioning
the IO phases in line with the campaign phase partitioning, [end of page 151] one should also plan the IO activities
prior to initiation of the joint campaign and after its conclusion so as to safeguard {baozhang} the smooth initiation
and conclusion of operations.

# (v) Command and coordination items

This mainly clarifies: the deployment location of the IO departments and campaign’s directly subordinate IO unit command
posts; their set-up time; organizing of command communications; and modes of command and main coordination items.

# 2. The joint campaign IO sub-plans

The joint campaign IO sub-plans are the specification the IO activities plan in a given aspect of IO activities. This
mainly includes: IO reconnaissance plan, information attack plan, information deception plan and the information defense
plan, etc.

The IO reconnaissance plan and its contents include: the goal and missions of IO reconnaissance; key-point targets of IO
reconnaissance; reconnaissance means and methods to be adopted; task-organization, deployment and task differentiation
of the IO reconnaissance force-strengths; support measures, etc.

The information attack plan and its contents include: the key-point targets, sequence and methods of information attack;
task-organization, deployment and mission differentiation of the information attack strengths; provisionally delegated
information attack missions to other operational strengths; non-specialized IO strengths missions and their organizing
methods; employment authority and time-opportunities for IO reserve forces.

The information deception plan and its contents include: the goal and missions of information defense;
task-organization, deployment and mission differentiation of the information deception strengths; adopted deception
means and methods; organization and requirements of information deception; support measures, etc.

The information defense plan and its contents include: organization and requirements of information defense; key-point
targets and means of information defense; specific courses of action of information defense; coordination content of
information defense; employment authority and time-opportunities of information reserve forces, etc.

On the basis of the IO form, one can also formulate an electronic warfare plan and a network warfare [end of page 152]
plan.

# 3. The joint campaign IO coordination plan

The joint campaign IO coordination plan refers to the plan formulated to allow consistent adjusting-coordination action
between various IO means, strengths and activities and to reduce unfavorable effects and interference between them. It
is a component of the joint campaign coordination plan. [In it,] one mainly should clarify the coordination between
joint campaign activities, coordination between friendly IO units, and coordination between various IO means,
operational strengths, operational activities of the units at one’s own level, etc. One should clarify with key-points
the objectives and tasks of coordination, [clarify the] relationships between activity times with space and
coordination, and [clarify] coordination measures and coordination stipulations, etc. The joint campaign IO coordination
plan can be singularly formulated or it can be formulated and merged with the joint campaign IO general plan {zongti
jihua}.

# (2) The joint campaign IO support plan

The joint campaign IO support plan’s main contents include: support mission differentiation; anticipated support
situations; support strength disposition and activity methods; support equipment allocation and employment; command and
coordination methods; time limit for carrying out tasks, etc. In the support plan, one should clarify contents such as
target support, communication support, support of classified {jiyao baozhang}, engineering support, electromagnetic
frequency spectrum management, nuclear, biological and chemical support, position [emplacement] alert and defense,
survey and mapping support, meteorological and hydrological support, battlefield management, etc.

The joint campaign IO support plan is agree upon and drafted by the joint campaign IO departments in conjunction with
other relevant departments. Normally, the IO plan and the joint campaign plan are merged and formulated together, but
they can also be singularly formulated. The detailed activity plan of specially designated IO is formulated by the
specific implementing organizational-unit and is reported above for approval.

# II. Methods for formulating the IO plan…153

Normally, one adopts the partitioning based on operational phase and a step-bystep method when formulating the IO plan.
[End of page 153]

First step, partition the IO phases and clarify the IO tasks of each phase

When formulating the IO plan, one normally partitions the operational phases with the joint campaign phases as the
basis. Afterwards, in accordance with the senior officer’s resolution and campaign general activities {zhanyi zongti
xingdong}, clarify the basic tasks of IO in each phase of the campaign.

Second step, anticipate the various IO situations and plan the various IO activities

Normally, one should, with the campaign activity general plan {zhanyi xingdong zongti jihua} as the basis for
anticipating the campaign situation, first anticipate the various situations that may occur in the IO of each campaign
phase, and then clarify the specific tasks of each IO unit in different situations and the operational activities and
various coordination items one should adopt.

Third step, form the operational planning document {zuozhan jihua wenshu} and promptly conduct revisions, improvements
and report to higher authorities

Promptly form the relevant contents into the operational planning document, and promptly report this to the chief of
staff for examination and approval. When the chief of staff puts forth revision suggestions, one should promptly conduct
revisions and improvements, and finally report this to the joint campaign commander for approval.

For the IO plan forms $\{ xin gsh i \}$ , one mainly has the written record form {wenzi $jis hus h i \}$ , tabular form
$\{ bia oge shi \}$ , annotated map form {ditu zhuji shi}, overall planning chart {tongchoutu shi}, multi-media form
{duo meiti shi}, etc. One can also combine several forms, for example, the written record form with the tabular and
annotated map forms.

# III. Requirements for formulating the IO plan…154

In formulating the IO plan, one should, with the senior officer’s campaign resolution as the basis, earnestly comprehend
the higher level intent, completely analyze the battlefield situation, scientifically predict battle situation
developments, and formulate an IO plan that conforms to battlefield realities.

The joint campaign IO department should, after receiving {jieshou} the inadvance order and receiving-accepting
{shouling} the operational missions, formulate the IO plan. Normally, one first drafts the initial plan so as to
safeguard {baozhang} that the units smoothly conduct operational preparations. After the senior officer sets the
campaign resolution, then, in accordance with the needs of joint campaign operations, [end of page 154], gradually
revise, replenish and improve so as to allow adjustingcoordination between the IO plan and the joint campaign operations
plan; establish a foothold in the most complex and difficult situations, be adept in forecasting the possible
developments and changes to the battlefield situation and conceptualize a variety of courses of action; perform unified
planning $\{ ton gyi jih u a \}$ , perform unified operations research-based planning {tongchou anpai} and arrangements,
and successfully plan with key-points the IO activities and critical time-occasion activities that have a significant
effect on the overall situation of operations; be thorough and detailed, allow for the unforeseen, and have flexibility
and adaptability; one must conduct campaign calculations, successfully calculate for essential factors such as targets,
strengths, times, activities, support, etc., and one must quantify, level-by-level, the operational units and specific
operational activities; when conditions exist, one should utilize computers to conduct simulation verifications; when
the situation is urgent of time is short, one can draft, issue and conduct activities at the same time. After the plan
is formulated, one must strictly pay attention to maintaining secrecy.

# Section 5: Organizing IO Coordination…155

Joint campaign IO coordination refers to the consistent adjusting-coordination of activities adopted by IO units to
accomplish their operational missions; its goal is to allow the various IO strengths to bring into play an
integrated-whole might and to strive for operational victory. The joint campaign commander and his command organ should,
on the basis of the joint campaign operations resolution {lianhe zhanyi zuozhan juexin}, the joint campaign activity
general plan {lianhe zhanyi xingdong zongti jihua} and the joint campaign IO general plan {lianhe zhanyi xinxi zuozhan
zongti jihua}, thoroughly organize joint campaign IO coordination.

# I. Organizing the coordination sequence…155

Organizing the sequence of IO coordination includes: convening the coordination meeting, issuing the coordination
instructions, and organizing coordination exercises.

(1) Convening the coordination meeting

The time-opportunity for convening the coordination meeting is normally after formulating the IO general plan [end of
page 155] and coordination plan, and after the IO commander has already set the initial resolution {chubu juexin}.
Ordinarily, one conducts this in a centralized manner at the main command post or at different locations synchronously
by utilizing the command information system, maps or sand tables.

(2) Issuing the coordination instructions

The joint campaign IO command organ should, on the basis of the instructions of the joint campaign commander at the
coordination meeting and one’s own level’s coordination plan, quickly draft and issue the coordination instructions. The
main contents include: the content and key points of IO coordination; the missions, activities (sequence, times) of IO
units in each coordination phase as well as coordination relationships; the time-opportunity and methods for
establishing and dispatching the coordination institution; the means and measures of supporting coordination; measures
when coordination is imbalanced or encounters disruption; coordination discipline and requirements, etc.

# (3) Organizing coordination exercises

The joint campaign commander and his command organ should organize the coordination exercises in accordance with the
coordination plan in order to become familiar, inspect-test, and perfect the coordination plan and support measures of
coordination and allow IO units to ascertain their missions, sequences and methods in each coordination phase.
Organizing coordination exercises can rely on an integrated data-link and command network for implementation.

# II. Methods of organizing coordination…156

In organizing joint campaign IO coordination, one normally conducts it based on the following methods and steps:
partition the coordination phases, clarify coordination tasks and coordination relationships, divide the operational
areas/zones and times, and divide the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, etc.

(1) Partitioning the coordination phases

Partitioning the coordination phases refers to the partitioning of phases performed for the coordinating the operational
progress. The coordination phases are normally identical to the IO activity phases. Sometimes, in order for coordination
to be more clear and specific, one can further perform a more detailed partitioning into a number of timeoccasions $\{
shi jie \}$ on the basis of partitioning the coordination phases. [End of page 156]

(2) Clarifying the coordination tasks

On the basis of partitioning the coordination phases, and in accordance with the joint campaign IO goal and operational
goals of each phase, perform unified clarification for the tasks of each IO unit in each coordination phase. Normally,
one conducts this based on the method of first in the main direction, next in the secondary direction, first in the main
activities, and next in the secondary activities.

# (3) Clarifying the coordination relationships

Clarifying coordination relationships refers to clarifying the supporting {zhiyuan} and complementing {peihe}
relationships between each IO unit in each coordination phase. After the coordination tasks are clarified, with the unit
executing the main IO missions of each coordination phase in the lead, clarify the main-secondary relationships of
coordination of each IO unit. After the coordination relationships are clear, the joint campaign commander can give
authority to the operational unit shouldering the main IO missions of the various coordination phases to put forth the
IO activity courses of action of their own phase as well as be responsible for performing operations research-based
planning and organizing of the IO coordination of their own phase.

(4) Dividing the operational areas/zones and times

Dividing the operational areas/zones and times is the stipulations made for each IO unit in the scope of space and time
for the various activities of a coordination phase. In dividing the operational areas/zones, one normally uses this when
organizing each operations group (grouping) and unit are implementing operational activities at the same time. One
should, on the basis of operational requirements and characteristics of the operational units, rationally partition the
operational areas/zones and avoid affecting each other. In divide the operational times, one normally uses this when
organizing each IO unit to carry out missions in the same space or strike the same target. One should, on the basis of
the characteristics of each IO unit and the requirements on attacking targets, rationally divide the times.

# (5) Dividing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum

Dividing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum refers to dividing up the electromagnetic frequency bands, and it is
normally used when organizing coordination such as early warning detection, technical reconnaissance, radio
communications and establishing contact, electronic confrontation, etc. [End of page 157] One should, on the basis of
such things as the operational missions, battlefield electromagnetic environment and information system performance,
correctly divide the electromagnetic frequency bands as well as their employment time-opportunities and methods, and
clarify coordination relationships and requirements.

# III. Content of organizing coordination…158

In organizing joint campaign IO coordination, the key points are the coordination between the joint campaign IO group
(grouping) and other operations groups (groupings), between the joint campaign IO groups (groupings) internally, and
between the joint campaign IO group (grouping) and other operations group (grouping) IO units. In joint campaign IO
coordination, the main body, key points and modes are different within different campaign IO activities.

(1) IO reconnaissance coordination

# 1. Electronic confrontation reconnaissance coordination

In electronic confrontation reconnaissance coordination, with the activities of the IO group’s (grouping’s) electronic
confrontation reconnaissance strength activities in the lead and participation from each associated operations group,
one normally organizes it based on the method of dividing by targets or one can also organize it based on the method of
dividing the electromagnetic frequency spectrum and time. When organizing coordination based on the division by target
method, the IO group (grouping) implements electronic confrontation reconnaissance mainly against the enemy’s important
targets such as command and control systems, early warning detection systems, and communication systems. The IO
reconnaissance strengths of each associated operations group (grouping), on the basis of the target distribution
situation and operational tasks, implements reconnaissance against the IO targets of the enemy it currently faces. When
necessary, through the use of some force-strengths and firepower, each operations group (grouping) guards against the
enemy conducting firepower strikes and electronic jamming on our IO reconnaissance strengths. When organizing
coordination based on the division of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum method, one mainly divides the frequency
bands of electronic confrontation reconnaissance and employment of electronic jamming so as to avoid affecting the
results of electronic jamming reconnaissance. When organizing coordination based on the time method, one mainly divides
the time-opportunities of each operations group’s electronic reconnaissance and jamming activities; when implementing
electronic confrontation reconnaissance, one should stop electronic jamming activities against the targets being
reconnoitered, and thus ensure one’s reconnaissance results.

# 2. Computer network reconnaissance coordination

In computer network reconnaissance coordination, with the activities of the IO group’s (grouping’s) computer network
reconnaissance strengths in the lead and with participation from special network warfare strengths {tezhong wangluozhan
liliang}, one normally organizes it based on the method of division of tasks. The IO group (grouping) mainly through
modes such as hacker sneak-ins, special software, electronic eavesdropping and utilizing seized enemy equipment, one
steals the various information from the enemy’s campaign information systems and computer networks; special network
warfare strengths are mainly responsible for sneaking into the enemy’ rear area vital site departments {houfang yaohai
bumen} (such as command posts, information centers, etc.) or land zones $\{ diy u \}$ ; inserting virus programs into
the enemy’s computer systems or directly conducting electromagnetic eavesdropping reconnaissance; when necessary, each
associated operations group safeguards {baozhang} the reconnaissance activities of the IO group (grouping) and special
operations group (grouping) with some force-strengths and firepower.

(2) Information attack coordination

# 1. Electronic attack coordination

In coordination of electronic attack activities, with the activities of the IO group’s (grouping’s) electronic attack
strength in the lead and participation from each associated operations group (grouping), one normally organizes
according to the division by target method, but one can also organize it based on division by electromagnetic frequency
spectrum, time and area-zone. When organizing coordination based on the division by target method, the IO group
(grouping) mainly implements electronic attack against the enemy, disrupts and weakens the operational effectiveness of
important information systems such as the enemy’s communication systems, early warning detection systems and command and
control systems, and seizes electromagnetic superiority. The electronic attack strengths of each associated operations
group (grouping) implements electronic jamming and suppression against the each type of information system of the enemy
they are facing on the basis of operational missions of their own group (grouping). Amongst this, special operations
task group {tezhong zuozhan jiqun} sneaking into the enemy’s rear area implements disruption-raid activities against the
important targets that cannot be effectively suppressed by electronic attack. When necessary, each associated operations
group (grouping) guards with a portion of their operational force-strengths and firepower against the enemy’s
implementation of firepower strikes against our electronic attack strengths. When we implement electronic attack
activities, [end of page 159] the IO reconnaissance strengths of each operations group (grouping) should continue to
conduct reconnaissance against the enemy’s important targets, and to understand and grasp the results of our attack
activities. When organizing coordination based on division of electromagnetic frequency spectrum method, one mainly
divides up the frequency spectrum used to implement electronic jamming against the enemy from the frequency spectrum of
our equipment employed by units having electronic equipment, so as to avoid unfavorable effects upon our operational activities. When organizing coordination based on the division of time
method, one mainly ascertains the priority sequence for implementing electronic attack against the enemy’s important
electronic targets by each operations group (grouping). When organizing coordination by division of areas-zones, one
mainly clarifies the areas-zones and directions for implementing electronic attack activities against the enemy by each
operations group (grouping).

# 2. Computer network attack coordination

In computer network attack coordination, with the activities of the IO group’s (grouping’s) computer network attack
strengths in the lead and with participation of special operations group (grouping) and other associated IO groups
(groupings), one normally organizes this based on the division by mission method. The IO group (grouping) mainly
implements attacks against the enemy’s computer networks and systems via modes such as hackers and infiltrations, etc.;
they decrease and destroy the functions of the enemy’s information processing systems; and paralyze and weaken the
operational effectiveness of the enemy’s command and control capabilities and information weapons and equipment. The
special operations group (grouping) is mainly responsible for sneaking into the enemy’s rear, approaching or directly
entering the enemy’s computer network systems, and implementing disruption and destruction. When necessary, each
associated operations group (grouping) safeguards {baozhang} the activities of the IO group (grouping) and special
operations group (grouping) with a portion of their operational force-strengths.

3. Coordination of conducting firepower strikes against the enemy’s information systems

In the coordination of conducting firepower strikes against the enemy’s information systems, with the activities of the
IO group’s (grouping’s) information attack strengths in the lead and participation by the on-land, at-sea, air and
Second Artillery operations groups {zuozhan jituan} and special operations task group {zuozhan jiqun}, one normally
organizes based on the division of targets method. One ordinarily implements firepower strike activities against the
enemy after electronic attack, but one may conduct it simultaneously mainly to directly conduct firepower strikes
against targets with bad results [end of page 160] from electronic attack; this further disrupts and thoroughly destroys
the important targets such as the enemy’s command and control centers, electronic information systems, and early warning
radar systems, etc. The Second Artillery operations group mainly destroys the enemy’s in-depth command systems and
important electronic targets, communication hubs, etc.; the on-land operations group mainly destroys the enemy’s command
posts, radar stations, radio jamming platforms and communication network platforms deployed near the forward edge; the
air operations group mainly destroys the important electronic targets and early warning aircraft in the enemy’s depths;
the special operations task group mainly implements harassment and disruption against targets such as the enemy’s
communication hubs, radar stations, command centers, etc. When conducting strikes against the enemy, the information attack strengths of the IO group (grouping) should conduct jamming and suppression
against the enemy’s anti-missile systems, early warning radar systems, fire control radar systems, etc. and safeguard
the smooth penetration and sustained strikes of our firepower strike strengths; the IO reconnaissance strengths should
continuously conduct reconnaissance against the enemy’s important targets and comprehend and grasp the effects of our
firepower strike activities so as to provide a reliance for further implementing strikes.

(3) Information defense coordination

1. Coordination for defending against the enemy’s information reconnaissance

Defending against enemy reconnaissance coordination. With the main operations group’s (grouping’s) information system
protection strength in the lead and with participation from other relevant operations groups (groupings), one normally
organizes this based on the method of division of tasks. The main operations group (grouping) information system
protection strength is responsible for ensuring our important information system’s safety $\{ anq uan \}$ and
information security $\{ bao m i \}$ . When the enemy implements information reconnaissance, each associated operations
group’s (grouping’s) information attack strength should temporarily maintain radio silence so as to avoid revealing
early our actual strength and activity intention, and under certain conditions, they can also implement jamming and
disruption against the enemy’s information reconnaissance systems; the information reconnaissance strengths should
unfold anti-reconnaissance activities at the appropriate time, and find out the deployment and parameters of the enemy’s
electronic reconnaissance weaponry as well as the enemy’s operational intent, etc. Each associated operations group
(grouping) should, depending on the situation, implement firepower strikes against the enemy’s information
reconnaissance weaponry and disrupt their reconnaissance activities; or [they should] implement force-strength feints
[end of page 161] and deceive and confuse the enemy.

2. Coordination for defending against the enemy’s electronic attack

Defending against the enemy’s electronic attack coordination is performed with the main operations group’s (grouping’s)
information system protection strength in the lead and with participation from other associated operations groups
(groupings); one normally organizes this based on the method of division of tasks. The main operations group’s
(grouping’s) information system protection strength is responsible for ensuring our important information systems’ safe
and stable operations and normal bringing into play of their functions each associated operations group’s (grouping’s)
electronic jamming strength is responsible for implementing jamming and suppression against the enemy’s information
attack weaponry. Within this, the IO group’s (grouping’s) electronic jamming strength should implement
counter-electronic jamming in the main direction and in the zones where important protection targets are deployed; the
information reconnaissance strength unfolds reconnaissance activities at the right time against the enemy, finds out the
deployment and parameters of the enemy’s electronic attack weaponry so as to facilitate our adoption of effective measures for conducting counterattack activities; each associated
operations group’s (grouping’s) firepower strike strength should, depending on the situation, conduct firepower strikes
against the enemy’s electronic attack weaponry and disrupt their electronic attack activities.

3. Coordination for defending against the enemy’s computer network attacks

In coordination for defending against the enemy’s computer network attacks, with the activities of the IO group’s
(grouping’s) computer network defense strength in the lead and with participation from each associated operations group
(grouping), one normally organizes this based on the method of division of tasks; the IO group’s (grouping’s) computer
network defense strength is mainly responsible for organizing activities such as defending against the enemy’s hacker
attacks, virus attacks and preventing electromagnetic leaks, etc., for preventing the enemy from utilizing their
computer networks to disrupt our information systems, and thus ensuring our network’s safety; the computer network
attack strength is responsible for implementing attacks against the enemy’s networks and achieve the goal of assisting
defense through offense; other associated operations groups (groupings) are responsible for the reinforcing the
protection within our computer network zones with a portion of force-strengths; and mainly to strictly defend against
the enemy’s special units from penetrating through and implementing disruption activities against our computer networks.

4. Coordination for defending against the enemy conducting firepower strikes against our information systems

In coordination for defending against the enemy conducting firepower strikes against our information systems, with the
activities of the main operations group (grouping) [end of page 162] in the lead and participation from each associated
operations group (grouping), one normally organizes this based on the method of division of tasks. The main operations
group (grouping) is responsible for synthetically applying various means to organize protection and resistances and for
ensuring the safety of our information systems; each associated operations group’s (grouping’s) firepower strike
strength is responsible for conducting resistance-attacks and counterattacks against the enemy’s firepower strike
weaponry and platforms, and for wiping out the special operations units (elements) penetrating our depths; the IO
group’s (grouping’s) electronic jamming strength is responsible for implementing jamming against the enemy’s precision
guidance weapon systems, influence their hit results, and screen the safety of our important military targets and
important electronic information systems.

# IV. Requirements of organizing coordination…163

At the same time as the joint campaign commander and his command organ organize IO coordination, one normally should
grasp in general terms the following issues:

(1) Focus on the overall situation, and conduct integrated-whole adjusting coordination

One must focus on the overall situation of the joint campaign, center on the general campaign tasks, combine the basic
fighting methods and the real situation of the given campaign, and conduct integrated-whole adjusting coordination for
the IO activities throughout the entire course of the campaign of each operations group (grouping), each type of
campaign pattern, each battlefield and in each campaign direction. Further make specific the IO tasks, and determine the
IO targets and tasks one must achieve from the overall perspective as well as the priority sequence for reaching the IO
objectives. [One must] conduct unified operations research-based planning and arrangements in terms of the sequence and
methods for campaign tasks, strengths employment, operational areas-zones, times and campaign activities for each
campaign pattern, each battlefield and campaign IO activities of each campaign direction, thus being able to allow for
consistent adjusting-coordination from the integrated-whole perspective and the campaign activities of each campaign
large formation, in particular the activities of the main direction’s campaign large formation.

(2) Grasp the layers, and give prominence to coordination key points

One must clarify with key points the coordination content, coordination relationships and coordination requirements
between IO activities and other campaign activities, and [one must] successfully grasp the coordination layers between
the IO activities of the operations group (grouping) [end of page 163] of each service and arm, each campaign direction
and various campaign patterns. Their internal campaign IO coordination is normally organized by the subordinate levels.

For organizing joint campaign IO coordination, in terms of IO strength employment, one must use the strengths carrying
out the main missions as the key point; in terms of organizing the implementation of IO activities, one must use the
main campaign patterns as the key point; in terms of the adjusting-coordination of operational spaces, one must use the
IO activities of the main battlefield and main campaign direction as the key points.

(3) With planned coordination in the lead, flexibly organize ad hoc coordination

The modes of joint campaign IO coordination are normally with planned coordination {jihua xietong} in the lead and a
combination of planned coordination and ad hoc coordination {suiji xietong}.

Planned coordination is complete and thorough, and it has an overall-situation quality guidance role for the
coordination of each phase of the campaign. When formulating the joint campaign IO coordination plan, one must place the
point of focus on the overall situation issue and the key point issues; and for the specific campaign course
coordination issues, one should make macroscopic and principal-quality stipulations so as to leave sufficient room for ad hoc coordination during the campaign course. Ad hoc coordination is
normally conducted by aiming at the local situations of the campaign course, and it has a stronger adaptability for
changes of the battlefield situation. When the situation exceeds the scope of the coordination plan or if the original
plan does not suit the given actual situations, one should flexibly organize ad hoc coordination. For organizing ad hoc
coordination, one can make adjustments or alter the original coordination plan based on the new situation; when there
are no fundamental changes occurring in the development progress of the campaign, the ad hoc coordination must still be
conducted and organized in accordance with the original coordination tasks and original principles.

(4) Adopt a variety of measures, and maintain uninterrupted coordination

In joint campaign IO coordination, its contents are many while its relationships are complex, and it can be easily
disrupted during the course of the campaign. For this reason, one should adopt the following measures: first is
perfecting the coordination mechanism $\{ wan sha nxi eto n g \}$ . The joint campaign command headquarters organizes
the planning of the employment of the participating IO strengths in a unified manner. It conducts a unified planning for
the operational activities of the IO units of each service and arm as well as performs unified coordination for the IO
and other operational activities. One can consider setting up an IO adjusting-coordination team within the joint
campaign command headquarters IO department to be composed from personnel dispatched from participating IO departments
of each service and arm; it [IO adjustingcoordination team] is represented by associated departments such as
intelligence and communications, and it organizes the campaign IO coordination in a unified manner. Second is
strengthening consultations [with each other] {jiaqiang xieshang}. The IO units of each service and arm having IO
coordination relationships should, on the basis of the IO coordination plan and instructions, promptly conduct
consultations [with each other] and resolve with key points any specific coordination issues. Consultations can be
organized by the joint campaign command institution dispatching of personnel or by designating the commander of a
certain campaign large formation to be responsible for organizing it. After consultations, one should form the activity
course of action {xingdong fang’an} each side must abide by in coordination; each side participating in the coordination
should, on their own initiative, organize activities based on the agreed upon items and ensure their implementation.
Third is strengthening analysis and forecasting and improving one’s ability to adapt. Taking aim at the specific
changing situations of the joint campaign IO battlefield situation, promptly adjust the original coordination contents
and allow the participating IO units of each service (or arm) to maintain uninterrupted coordination from start to
finish.

# Section 6: Organizing Synthesized Support {zuzhi zonghe baozhang}…165

After formulating the IO plan, the joint campaign commander should, at the appropriate time, guide the IO departments to
organize operational, logistic and equipment support and to clarify with key points support tasks, support
relationships, key points and requirements. In organizing various supports, one should adhere to the principles of have
preparations in advance; perform unified operations research-based planning and deal with all things; complete support;
and give prominence to key points. [In organizing various supports, one should] actively create and fully utilize
various favorable conditions; synthesize the application of various support modes and methods; bring into play the
integrated-whole composite might of all services and arms and local support strengths.

# I. Organizing operational support…165

The joint campaign commander and his command organ should put operations support of the joint campaign into the joint
operations plan, and organize its implementation in a unified manner. Normally, [end of page 165] the joint campaign IO
command institution puts forth the IO support requirements and the relevant support departments organize the
implementation according to plan. After the IO support plan is formulated, one should promptly issue the corresponding
operational support instructions. On the basis of the instructions of higher level and their own level’s commanders, the
IO support plan as well as the IO needs-requirements, organize in a unified manner the operational supports such as
target support, communications support, classified security support, engineering support, electromagnetic frequency
spectrum management, nuclear-biological-chemical support, position alert and guarding and survey-mapping support,
meteorological-hydrological support, battlefield management, etc.; perform guidance, control and adjusting-coordination
for the various IO support strengths, flexibly apply modes such as a combination of specialized support strengths with
non-specialized support strengths and a combination of standard production {制式 zhishi} and non-standard {fei zhishi}
equipment and instruments, and completely unfold support activities with key points.

# II. Organizing logistic support…166

The joint campaign commander and his command organ should put the logistic support of joint campaign IO into the joint
campaign logistic support plan and organize its implementation in a unified manner. Normally, the joint campaign IO
command institution puts forth the relevant IO logistic support requirements, and the associated support departments
organize and implement it based on the plan. After the IO logistic support plan is formulated, one should promptly issue
the IO logistic support instructions. On the basis of the higher level and one’s own level commander’s instructions, the
IO logistic support plan and the needs-requirements of IO activities, organize in a unified manner the logistic support
such as IO materiel, medical, traffic and transport and cost; perform control and adjusting-coordination for the various
support activities; flexibly apply modes such as a combined area-zone support with established structure support, and a
combined general-use support with special-use support; and unfold logistic support activities.

# IV. Organizing equipment support…166

The joint campaign commander and his command organ should put the equipment support of joint campaign IO into the joint
campaign equipment support plan, and organize and implement it in a unified manner. Normally, the joint campaign IO
command institution puts forth the relevant IO equipment support requirements, [end of page 166] and the associated
support departments organize and implement in accordance with the plan. After the IO equipment support plan is
formulated, one should promptly issue the IO equipment support instructions. On the basis of the higher level and one’s
own level commander’s instructions, the IO equipment support plan and the IO activity needs-requirements, organize in a
unified manner the IO equipment materiel, technical, management and cost supports. Perform control and
adjusting-coordination for the various IO equipment support activities; flexibly apply modes such as area-zone support
with established structure support, unified support with separate support, planned support with emergency support,
level-by-level support with skip-echelon support, etc.; and unfold equipment support activities.

# Section 7: Organizing Wartime Political Work…167

In organizing wartime political support, one should put IO political work into the joint campaign political work plan
and organize and implement it in a unified manner. After the wartime IO political work plan is formulated, one should
promptly issue the IO political work instructions. The joint campaign commander and his political organ should, on the
basis of the IO missions, guide each operations group’s (grouping’s) IO units to take aim at the IO characteristics and
promptly and thoroughly conduct political mobilization and propaganda education; use the orders and instructions of the
Party Central Committee, the CMC and higher levels to unify the thought and activities of combat-participating
personnel; allow the collective combat-participating personnel to comprehend higher level intent; clarify the IO goals,
missions, meaning, favorable factors and unfavorable conditions as well as the methods for gaining victory and subduing
the enemy; thoroughly conduct patriotism, collectivism and revolutionary heroism education; and arouse
combat-participating enthusiasm and combat spirit. Organize and unfold the organizing work and cadre work as well as the
activities of military democracy and establishing a model of meritorious service; organize the implementation of
psychological warfare, public opinion warfare and legal warfare; and successfully accomplish the mass work in the
operations area. [End of page 167]

# Section 8: Organizing IO Unit Unfolding…168

IO unit unfolding is the activity whereby one, on the basis of the task-organization of the joint campaign IO strength,
maneuvers the participating IO strengths of all services and arms to the assembly (standby) zones. The goal is to gather
the operational strengths, form a favorable pre-battle posture, and ensure prompt initiation of IO. The IO strengths of
each combat-participating service or arm, except for the first line electronic reconnaissance units, are ordinarily
dispositioned in the shallow depths. Therefore, in the campaign preparations phase, one should, on the basis of the
campaign intent, campaign strength task-organization, pre-determined operations plan, and missions undertaken by each IO
unit, under the unified command and adjusting-coordination of the joint campaign command institution, and in accordance
with the operational disposition and the stipulated time, implement maneuver and unfolding of force-strengths and
weaponry, enter the pre-designated battle standby location, and complete the campaign unfolding.

In order to safeguard the rapid and concealed maneuvers of each IO unit, the joint campaign commander and his command
organ should guide the IO units, and on the basis of the general maneuver and unfolding resolution and proposal, set the
IO unit maneuver and unfolding resolution. The main contents of the maneuver and unfolding resolution are: the goal and
tasks of maneuver and unfolding, the maneuver routes, maneuver disposition, maneuver sequence, departure start time,
arrival time limits, unfolding area, communications and maintaining contact, organizing of command and various support
measures, etc.

The maneuver route {jidong luxian}. Normally, one should partition the maneuver route based on the terrain of the
operations area, condition of the roads and deployment locations of each IO grouping $\{ qun \}$ with each IO grouping
as the organizational-unit {danwei}. When two or more organizational-units are maneuvering on the same route, one should
divide up the maneuver time.

The maneuver disposition {jidong bushu}. This should be determined on the basis of the pre-determined operational
disposition and the maneuver road conditions; one normally separately maneuvers along different directions and multiple
roads and multiple echelons. Based on the situation, each [end of page 168] IO reconnaissance grouping can maneuver
before other IO groupings, while each IO grouping can move in at the same time as the reserve forces or after.

The maneuver mode. In organizing IO unit maneuver across areas-zones, the distances are long, time is urgent, modes many
and organization and command are more complex. Normally, one should, on the basis of the campaign missions and
deployment locations, combine the current enemy situation, traffic support and one’s own maneuver capabilities,
synthesize the application with a variety of modes such as public roads, railroads and aerial transport, prepare a
variety of maneuver preliminary proposals {jidong yu’an}, rapidly make a selection based on the battlefield situation,
and flexibly implement it; on the basis of the actual situation of the unit’s peacetime dispersed disposition,
simultaneously organize multiple echelons $\{ duo get ici \}$ from several directions with a variety of modes to quickly
move into the operational zones; taskorganize the units in the same direction of maneuver into a number of marching
echelons $\{ xin gju nti dui \}$ following multiple routes and divided into many echelons, they disperse and move in
towards the operational areas-zones.; one can also synthesize the application of the aforementioned modes, adopt modes
such as a maneuver that is a blended taskorganizational grouping $\{ bia nzu \}$ , a maneuver of multiple roads and
multiple directions, batch-by-batch maneuver, seeking gaps segment-by-segment maneuver, etc.

When organizing maneuver and unfolding, the IO command institution must be under the unified plan of the joint campaign
command headquarters, scientifically calculate and select the favorable maneuver time-opportunity, and allow each
service and arm IO strength to be able to arrive at position in a concealed and rapid manner and on time; on the basis
of completely analyzing the situations of both sides, and from needsrequirements and possible departure, weigh the
battlefield conditions, strive to select the maneuver routes where concealment and maneuver conditions are better, thus
facilitating maneuvering in multiple batches, multiple directions and multiple echelons and as much as possible avoiding
areas-zones where one easily encounters enemy detection and raids; in order to allow for concealed, rapid and safe
maneuver of each IO unit (element), one should adopt various measures to conduct reliable support. As much as possible
utilize the dark of night, bad weather and favorable terrain, adopt technical camouflage means, and complement with
electronic feints and deception, manufacture false intelligence, set up false targets, strictly blockade news
information, successfully accomplish traffic and protection support and logistic support, and ensure the safe, smooth
and concealed accomplishment of campaign unfolding.

After the units arrive at the assembly (standby) zones, one should conduct indepth and echelon deployments according to
the operational disposition and priority order for entering into engagements, [end of page 169] successfully accomplish
concealment camouflage, and quickly complete operational preparations.

# Section 9: Organizing Imminent Battle Training and Supervision of Operational Preparations…170

During the campaign preparations phase, the joint campaign commander and his command organ should promptly organize
their subordinate IO units to conduct directedquality imminent battle training and earnestly supervise and inspect the
units as they complete operational preparations.

# I. Organizing imminent battle training…170

Prior to campaign initiation, the IO group (grouping) and the IO units of each service and arm should conduct
directed-quality training on the basis of their own operational missions, operational characteristics, and the theater’s
natural geographical and meteorological-hydrological situations.

In imminent battle training, one mainly conducts the following directed-quality training: first is new type weapons and
equipment training. Based on the IO missions, operational characteristics and fighting methods of the operational
object, supervise-urge and guide each IO unit to conduct strengthening of imminent battle familiarization and mastery of
new-type weapons and equipment training, as quickly as possible achieve organic combination of man and weapon and form
combat power. Second is IO fighting method confrontation training. Based on the IO fighting method put forth in the IO
resolution and while directed at the object of operations and the IO tasks of the unit, organize the unit to conduct the corresponding IO fighting method confrontation training so as to allow the unit to be
able to proficiently grasp and apply IO fighting methods. Third is IO coordination training. Based on the missions and
mutual coordination relationships of each unit in each phase of operations entrusted by the IO resolution and plan,
organize and guide the units to conduct coordination training, reduce coordination mistakes and improve the IO
strength’s capability in coordinated operations.

For the procedures and methods of organizing imminent battle training, normally, on the basis of the IO
task-organizational grouping $\{ bia nzu \}$ and missions, [end of page 170] one first learns theory and unifies
thought, and then one conducts real exercise training; first, each IO grouping $\{ qun \}$ performs separate training,
then the IO group {jituan} (grouping {qun}) performs combined training $\{ hel ian \}$ ; first conduct exercises on the
map, sand table and computer, then conduct live force exercises. The various imminent battle training should pay
attention to not reveal PLA operational intention.

In organizing imminent battle training, one must adhere to the characteristics of time urgency, many in content, and
high in requirements, and thoroughly plan and strictly organize it; on the basis of peacetime training, one must give
prominence to the urgently needed key point and difficult point subjects training and especially coordination training;
one must undergo imminent battle training, and inspect-test and perfect the IO plan; IO imminent battle training should
simultaneously organize and implement combined information deterrence and feint-deception simultaneously.

# II. Supervising operational preparations…171

During the course of operational preparations as well as after basically completing operational preparations, the joint
campaign commander and his command organ should instruct the IO command institution to organize the supervision and
inspection of IO units at the appropriate times to complete their operational preparations.

The contents of supervising operational preparations normally include: the comprehension level of the IO units of each
service and arm for the IO resolution and instructions; whether each IO unit’s resolution and plans conform to the
senior officer’s intent; whether operations, logistic and equipment support and political work conform to higher level
instructions and the requirements of the unit’s operational missions; the comprehension level for the IO coordination
plan; the organizing situation of the command post and the command information systems; and other situations in
completing IO preparations, etc.

Supervising operational preparations normally adopts the following methods: the commander himself inspects the units;
the commander or the command institution sends an inspection team to the units for inspection; listening to subordinate
level reports on the imminent battle preparations; inquiring and checking-approving the documents and reports concerning
IO preparations; utilizing battlefield real-time monitoring systems to conduct monitoring and provide feedbacks.

Supervising operational preparations should give priority to the IO units [end of page 171] executing the main IO
missions; give prominence to the key points of supervision and for issues discovered during inspection and situations
made known by the unit, one should promptly resolve them. Normally, one should resolve upon discovery, but for
significant problems, one can centralize and resolve them in a unified manner. Issues unable to be resolved at one’s own
level must be promptly reported to higher levels and request higher levels to resolve them. For lower level IO
resolutions and plans that do not correspond to reality nor conform to the general operational intent {zongde zuozhan
yitu}, one must explicitly make corrections. [end of chapter]

# Chapter 9 Implementation of Joint Campaign Information Operations…173

Implementation of joint campaign information operations [IO] is the series of IO activities unfolded that relies on the
joint campaign IO resolution and plan and mainly centers on IO reconnaissance, information attack and information
defense. During its implementation, one should carry out the principles of be guided by reconnaissance {zhencha
xiandao}, combine attack and defense $\{ gon g - fan gji ehe \}$ , and give priority to attack {yigong weizhu};
concentrate the employment of IO strengths in the main direction and important time occasions $\{ zho ngy a o \ shi jie
\}$ ; strike with key points the vital site parts of the enemy’s information systems; simultaneously organize
successfully the protection of one’s own information systems; and strive to seize and maintain localized information
dominance.

# Section 1: IO Reconnaissance Activities {xingdong}…173

In IO reconnaissance is mainly the reconnaissance activity {zhencha huodong} adopted that is backed up by the joint
campaign intelligence reconnaissance tixi system in order to collect the needed intelligence for IO. It is the
foundation for implementing information attack activities {xingdong}, and it has an important role in correctly setting
the IO resolution and rationally employing IO strengths.

# I. IO reconnaissance missions…173

The goals of IO reconnaissance are to provide reliable information intelligence for the commander to correctly set the
IO resolution and even the joint campaign resolution, to promptly provide intelligence data to each service or arm
participating in combat, and to create conditions for implementing IO. Its main missions are: [end of page 173] to
ascertain the enemy’s IO intention, plans and courses of action {jihua fang’an}, and activity disposition {xingdong
bushu}; the types, deployment $\{ pei zhi \}$ , performance and employment means of the enemy’s reconnaissance
monitoring systems, in particular the situation of the IO system’s critical nodes {guanjian jiedian} as well as the
methods and measures of their information defense; the main means and strengths of the enemy’s information systems
implementing attacks against us; the situations of the utilizable civilian information system facilities and equipment;
simultaneously and actively gather the reactions of associated nations towards our joint campaign IO; and other
information reconnaissance missions, etc.

# II. IO reconnaissance activities {xingdong}..174

IO reconnaissance activities can ordinarily be divided into activities such as electronic confrontation reconnaissance,
radar reconnaissance, radio technical reconnaissance, network reconnaissance, etc.

# (1) Electronic confrontation reconnaissance

In electronic reconnaissance, one mainly applies electronic confrontation reconnaissance equipment, gathers and acquires
the electromagnetic emanation signals of the enemy’s electronic equipment, and through analysis and identification, one
gathers their tactical and technical parameters and their data situations. The first is radar confrontation
reconnaissance. For this, one mainly employs various equipment of radar confrontation reconnaissance to form a radar
confrontation reconnaissance network {leida duikang zhencha wangzhan $\}$ , adopts a variety of position-fix methods and
means, determines the enemy’s radar locations, and ascertains the technical parameters and tactical characteristics of
the enemy’s radars. Second is communications confrontation reconnaissance. One mainly employs a variety of means such as
fixed or mobile ground stations and electronic confrontation reconnaissance aircraft and methods such as radio
communications monitoring, direction finding and position fixing to search for the enemy’s radio communication signals
and ascertain the enemy’s radio communication equipment locations. Third is electro-optical confrontation
reconnaissance. One mainly utilizes various equipment of electro-optical confrontation reconnaissance, adopts modes such
as laser confrontation reconnaissance and infrared confrontation reconnaissance, and acquires the enemy’s
electro-optical emanation source signals and target infrared emanation signals. Fourth is hydro-acoustic confrontation
reconnaissance. One mainly utilizes various installed equipment for sonar detection to conduct search, directionfinding
and position fixes, identification and tracking of targets in the water and support the smooth implementation of at-sea
IO.

# (2) Radar reconnaissance

In radar reconnaissance, one mainly utilizes radars such as battlefield reconnaissance radars, ground-to-air
intelligence radars, [end of page 174] surface-to-sea alert radars, ground artillery radars and early warning radars to
conduct long range, allweather, rapid and highly precise reconnaissance against the enemy so as to provide long range
air situations. Amongst these, the battlefield reconnaissance radar mainly provides reconnaissance for Army units and it
monitors the enemy’s vehicles and personnel on the battlefield; the ground-to-air intelligence radars include alert
radars, target indication radars and vector-guidance radars mainly to be used to search for, detect and identify air
targets; the surface-to-sea alert radars are ordinarily installed on various types of sea surface ships or installed on
shore or islands and are used for detecting sea surface ships and flying targets at low altitudes or very low altitudes.

# (3) Radio technical reconnaissance

In radio technical reconnaissance, one mainly conducts reconnaissance activities through electronic reconnaissance
satellites, electronic reconnaissance aircraft, electronic reconnaissance boats, ground reconnaissance stations and
air-dropped electronic reconnaissance equipment. It mainly includes radio communication signals reconnaissance and
non-communication signals reconnaissance. Radio communication signals intelligence mainly applies means such as radio reconnaissance to receive, monitor, direction find, signals
analysis, code-breaking, comprehensive check translation {综合校译 zonghe jiaoyi}, it ascertains with key points the enemy’s
IO intention, activity disposition, command and control system composition and deployment, and technical parameters of
important weapons and equipment. For non-communication signals reconnaissance, one mainly applies non-communication
signals reconnaissance means to conduct reconnaissance surveillance and analytical processing for the enemy’s signals
such telemetry, remote control, remote sensor, radar, navigational guidance and identification friend or foe, and space
targets {kongjian mubiao} etc; it ascertains with key points the situations such as the composition, disposition and
technical parameters of the enemy’s systems such as the missile early warning, radar detection, and weapons control, as
well as space target operating orbits, etc.

# (4) Network reconnaissance

In future PLA joint campaign IO implemented against the enemy, in order to utilize computer networks to conduct “virus”
attacks against the enemy, we must first grasp the situations such as their software types, structural functions, work
processes, weak links and protection measures, and only by grasping these situations will we be able to develop $\{ yan
zhi \}$ “viruses” with a focused quality to attack-enter the enemy’s networks or conduct protection with a focused
quality. Network reconnaissance is the activity of conducting reconnaissance against computer networks through specific
reconnaissance [end of page 175] technologies {zhencha jishu} and entering the enemy’s computer networks using
legitimate user identification {yi hefa yonghu shenfen}; it is mainly to conduct searches {检索 jiansuo}, browsing {浏览
liulan}, cutting sections {截 取 jiequ}, modifying {修改 xiugai} and deleting {删除 shanchu} on-line data and documents
{wangshang ziliao, wenjian}. During the course of IO reconnaissance, the campaign commander and his IO command
institution should at the right time organize the IO network reconnaissance strength to synthetically apply technical
means such as network search $\{ wan glu o \ sou suo \}$ , computer scans {jisuanji saomiao}, decoding {mima $poy i \}$
, signal processing {xinhao fenxi}, protocol decryption $\{ xie yij iem i \}$ ; they should ascertain with key points
the situations such as the communication tizhi system, modulation-control modes, topology, network protocols, circuit
security, security protection mechanisms and operating system features and distribution frailties of the enemy’s
computer network systems so as to provide intelligence for organizing and implementing network attacks and other
operational activities.

# III. Requirements of IO reconnaissance…176

IO reconnaissance possesses the characteristics of multi-elements of strength, complexity of situations, and great
degree of difficulty in organizing and implementing. In order to fulfill the needs-requirements of the entirety of joint
campaign operations, IO units (elements) should, based on the missions undertaken, mainly grasp the following issues
during IO reconnaissance:

(1) Thoroughly plan, and meticulously perform operations research-based planning {zhoumi jihua, jingxin chouhua}

IO reconnaissance can not only be implemented independently, but it can also be organized and implemented while blended
into all campaign reconnaissance activities under the unified plans of a joint campaign command organ. When conducting
IO reconnaissance activities against the enemy’s strategic depths, it is a unified organization by a joint campaign
command headquarters and it is implemented mainly by employing ground, sea and air IO reconnaissance strengths
possessing long range reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities within the campaign task-organization. In
reconnaissance against the enemy’s on-land shallow depth IO situations, one mainly employs Army IO strengths and
implements it with support {zhiyuan} and complement from the IO reconnaissance strengths of other services and arms, and
Armed Police and people and masses reconnaissance strengths. For reconnaissance of the enemy’s at-sea IO situations, one
mainly employs Navy IO reconnaissance strengths and implements it under the support {zhiyuan} and complement of sea
reconnaissance strengths of other services and arms as well as those of the local area. For reconnaissance against the
enemy’s air IO situations, [end of page 176] one mainly employs Air Force IO reconnaissance strengths and implements it
under the support $\{ zhi yua n \}$ and complement of the air reconnaissance strengths of other services and arms as
well as those of the local area. Prior to carrying out missions, each IO reconnaissance unit (element) should establish
the organization before hand and clarify responsibilities; on the basis of higher level intent, IO needs and our IO
reconnaissance capability, one should determine the goals and missions of IO reconnaissance; the joint campaign IO
department should, jointly with the intelligence center and centering on the main direction and important activities of
IO, thoroughly formulate the IO reconnaissance plan based on the joint campaign IO plan. Its main contents include: the
enemy’s IO capability, main means and activity characteristics {huodong tedian}; PLA IO reconnaissance goals and
missions; key point reconnaissance activities and targets, and adopted reconnaissance means, methods and steps; the
missions of various IO reconnaissance strengths, their task-organizational grouping and support measures, etc. After the
IO reconnaissance plan is determined, one should at the right time issue the campaign IO reconnaissance instructions to
the units, and at the appropriate time, supervise and inspect the units to complete their reconnaissance missions
according to plan.

# (2) Perfect the tixi system, and synthetically apply

When organizing the implementation of IO reconnaissance, one must rely on the campaign reconnaissance tixi system, smash
the phenomena of each service or arm and department doing things their own way, and in accordance with the
needs-requirements of the integrated-whole of campaign IO and its requirements, [one must] establish an IO
reconnaissance tixi system that is integration-compatible with the campaign reconnaissance tixi system and achieves
information sharing, resource sharing and maximally satisfies IO needs-requirements. One should organize with key points
the campaign IO reconnaissance strength and synthetically apply the various reconnaissance means; one should conduct
task-organizational grouping in a unified manner for the IO reconnaissance strengths of the campaign large formation
subordinate units and form a collectively integrated multi-layered, in-depth, and omni-directional IO reconnaissance
tixi system for information gathering, information transmission, information processing and information use; [this tixi
system] is organically blended with higher level intelligence reconnaissance system {xitong}, thus ensuring that one is
able to gather the relevant intelligence information from within the higher level intelligence reconnaissance system
needed for campaign IO. [End of page 177]

(3) Reconnaissance in advance, and combine peacetime and wartime

Peacetime reconnaissance is the foundation for wartime reconnaissance; wartime reconnaissance is the continuation of
peacetime reconnaissance; and only by grasping with key points the situations of the enemy’s battlefield information
functions and IO capabilities in peacetime can one be able to establish a firm basis for implementing IO in wartime. To
this end, in peacetime, one should comprehend and grasp with key points the relevant situations of the enemy’s IO
exercises, and grasp the relevant situations of the enemy’s strategic, campaign and tactical information systems and IO
fighting methods; the command organs at each level should strengthen their study of contents such as IO reconnaissance
organization and implementation and main means and methods of IO reconnaissance; one should strengthen campaign IO
reconnaissance strength building and specialized talent cultivation and reserves while improving as quickly as possible
the levels and capabilities of PLA to implement network reconnaissance; strengthen the comprehensive exercises of IO
reconnaissance and improve the level and capability of the PLA to implement IO reconnaissance; adopt effective measures,
revise reconnaissance plans at the right time, adjust IO reconnaissance strength dispositions, and ensure achieving
rapid transitions from peacetime to wartime.

# Section 2: Information Attack Activities…178

Joint campaign information attack is the series of operational activities that is combined with firepower strikes and
special disruptions to seize and maintain campaign localized information dominance and it has the enemy’s strategic and
campaign systems and operational information as the main attack targets; its main means are electronic attack, network
attack, special information warfare weapons attack, psychological attack and information deception; and its goal is to
weaken the enemy’s capability to gather, transmit, process and use information.
