# CHAPTER 1

## CCP DECISION-MAKING AND XI JINPING'S CENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY

### Abstract

Over the past ten years, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping has undertaken a wide-ranging
effort to restructure decision-making processes within the Chinese Party-state that will continue to have effects at the
20th Party Congress and beyond. Xi has augmented his own authority and systematically centralized decision-making power
across all policy areas, preserving and enhancing the CCP's capacity to dominate policymaking and expanding his own
authority to drive China's policy agenda. This top-down approach aims to unify the government and the nation under the
Party and deliver on Xi's aspirations of enhancing China's strength while avoiding what he perceives as the shortcomings
of his predecessors' leadership. Nevertheless, Xi's centralization of decision-making power may reduce the adaptability
of lower-level governments and encourage the CCP's reliance on policy approaches that are poorly suited to address
China's structural challenges. Should these trends continue, challenges to the United States may include more
unpredictable economic policy decision-making, a more assertive foreign policy agenda, and a more aggressive military
posture.

### Key Findings

- General Secretary Xi's decision-making power has increased dramatically over the past decade, to the point that CCP
media have recast the previously negative term "decision by one authority" as a positive feature of China's system. Xi
has also overhauled Party rules to give himself an outsized role in the overall governance of the CCP and of China. Xi
will likely maintain his high level of control after the October 20th Party Congress and the spring 2023 National
People's Congress.

- Under Xi's leadership, the CCP has restructured China's policymaking apparatus by taking decision-making functions
away from government bodies and placing them into Party organs, such as leading small groups and commissions. This shift
bolsters the CCP's oversight of policy formulation and implementation to ensure stricter adherence to the Party line and
marks a departure from prior CCP leaders' more broadly consultative policy-making process.

• Policy decision-making is increasingly centralized and synonymous with Xi's personal leadership, equating loyalty to
the Party with loyalty to him. This trend improves policy coordination at the possible expense of policy flexibility,
leading to campaign-style governance that effectively addresses short-term issues but limits CCP leaders' ability to
correct policy mistakes.

• Xi seeks to avoid the perceived errors of the Soviet Union and China's reform-era leaders. He asserts that previously
lax and weak governance by his immediate predecessors damaged the CCP's reputation, cohesiveness, and national
governance abilities.

• Xi is enhancing central control over economic decision-making in an effort to ensure the preservation of the regime.
Xi justifies this centralization by claiming he and the Party are uniquely capable of steering China toward an
increasingly ambitious and nationalistic set of modernization plans. These intentions fail to reconcile with the
systemic ailments afflicting China's economy, which Xi and the CCP have chosen to mask by replacing the previous metric
of gross domestic product (GDP) maximization with a proliferating number of top-down mandates and increased central
enforcement.

• Xi has restructured the foreign policy decision-making apparatus to facilitate a unified and centrally directed
approach to addressing international threats and achieving national objectives. The conduct of Chinese diplomacy now
reflects his preference for a more aggressive and confrontational style.

• Xi has restructured the military and paramilitary apparatus to increase centralization and vest more authority in his
own hands. Decisions on the use of China's military and paramilitary forces are subject to an increase in the personal
discretion exercised by Xi.

## Recommendations

The Commission recommends:

• Congress pass legislation creating a new Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) (to replace the Open
Source Center closed in 2015) that will translate and maintain a publicly available collection of important open source
material from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and other countries of strategic interest. This legislation should
require existing FFRDCs to provide to this new entity a copy of all open source Chinese-language materials collected or
used in any government-sponsored analytical or related projects on an ongoing basis.

• Congress direct the Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence to produce an unclassified directory of
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) senior members and organizations, similar to the "Directory of PRC Military Personalities"
produced and updated by the U.S. Department of Defense.
○ The directory should be updated on an annual basis and consist of an unclassified public report on the CCP, including
the Party's organizational structure (including organizations affiliated with the United Front Work Department) and profiles of leaders and organizations at least to the level that the
CCP defines as "senior cadre."

○ The contents of each year's directory should be retained in the form of an unclassified, publicly available,
searchable database of CCP members and organizations.

## Introduction

At the 20th National Congress of the CCP, scheduled to begin on October 16, 2022, roughly 2,300 CCP delegates will
likely extend Xi's leadership and endorse new candidates for positions within the Party.* This reshuffle will be
followed shortly thereafter by the National People's Congress (NPC) in early 2023 for turnover of the state leadership.¹
These major political events are occurring against the backdrop of Xi's intense consolidation and assertion of power
over the last decade. Xi's likely priorities for the Party Congress are to continue strengthening his ability to
exercise complete political control and ensure personal loyalty from all levels of the CCP. An evaluation of how Xi has
changed decision-making processes in China's political system helps to understand the outcome of the Party Congress and
how the United States can prepare for it.

Xi is upending recent patterns of decision-making and policy formulation that emerged in the post-Mao era.² In response
to the Party's perceived weaknesses under prior leaders, Xi has sought to strengthen the mechanisms for the Party's
leadership over all organs of governance, neutralize threats to CCP authority, and equip the CCP with the governance
tools it needs to achieve its objectives.³ Xi's emphasis on protecting and promoting the CCP's authority in governing
China means the Party is expanding its role in decision-making across all policy areas. Furthermore, Xi's style of
leadership makes personal loyalty to him synonymous with loyalty to the Party. These dynamics mean Xi's policy
preferences have an outsized impact on decision-making, as national and local government bodies must implement policies
that adhere to his agenda.

This section evaluates the CCP's decision-making structure and policy formation process under Xi's leadership. The
section begins with an assessment of how and why the CCP's decision-making norms have evolved under Xi's leadership. It
then reviews the specific features of CCP decision-making processes under Xi across economic, foreign, and security
policy. The section draws on the Commission's January 2022 hearing on "CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress," con-
sultations with experts, and open source research and analysis.

*As of this Report's writing, the CCP is expected to convene its 20th National Congress on October 16, 2022. These
congresses are held once every five years. Delegates to the Congress elect the CCP Central Committee and the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection. The CCP Central Committee is a political body comprising China's top political
leadership (currently 204 members and 172 alternates). According to the CCP charter, the Central Committee is vested
with the power to select the Politburo (a group of 25 people who oversee the CCP). Within the Chinese political system,
the ultimate power resides with the Politburo Standing Committee (nominally elected by the Central Committee). The
current Politburo Standing Committee has seven members, with Xi Jinping serving as the General Secretary of the CCP and
China's head of state. Xinhua, "The CCP Central Committee Politburo Meeting Suggests that the Party's 20th National

## The Evolution of CCP Decision-Making

As one of the CCP's most revered revolutionary leaders and the
founder of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Mao Zedong en-
joyed a position of singular authority in China's political system
until his death in 1976.4 At the Zunyi Conference during the CCP's
Long March in January 1935, Mao for the first time overcame the
intra-Party disputes that had placed an upper limit on his political
control of the CCP to become the Party's undisputed leader.5 With
the founding of the PRC, Mao was in a position to play a decisive
role in shaping the construction of China's nascent governance insti-
tutions and guiding the country's policy direction. He was known for
his hands-on involvement in policy decision-making, particularly in
the foreign policy and security realms where his personal diplomacy
with foreign leaders largely set the course for China's diplomatic re-
lations.6 Mao did not always exercise his decision-making authority
through the formal bureaucratic mechanisms of the Party-state, and
he even stopped attending Politburo meetings after 1959.7 Despite
his domestic position at the pinnacle of China's Party-state, Mao
possessed a profound distrust of institutions that led him to repeat-
edly circumvent both government and Party bureaucracies in favor
of stirring up mass movements to accomplish his policy goals.8 His
domination had destabilizing and deadly consequences, such as the
economic disaster of the Great Leap Forward that led to millions
of deaths by starvation and the ideological excess of the Cultural
Revolution that persecuted China's political elite.9 Although Mao
established the leading role for the CCP in Chinese society, his lead-
ership approach also sometimes threatened the CCP's stability as a
ruling organization.

CCP leaders in the post-Mao era, up through Hu Jintao's ten-
ure, made deliberate efforts to prevent the concentration of deci-
sion-making power in one top leader. Mao Zedong's unassailable
authority over the CCP and his dictatorial governance of China led
to continued disastrous policies despite mounting evidence of their
failure.10 To prevent leaders from exercising such outsized power
and influence, successive CCP leaders in the post-Mao era gradually
adopted a "collective leadership" model* to ensure the top leader
consulted with an executive group of other leaders in the Politburo
Standing Committee when making decisions.11

Hu Jintao's leadership of the CCP from 2002 to 2012 saw the peak
of the collective leadership model.12 A communique from the CCP's
17th Party Congress, held in 2007, formally defined the model as "a
system with a division of responsibilities among individual leaders
in an effort to prevent arbitrary decision-making by a single top
leader."13 The CCP's adoption of a collective leadership model insti-
tuted a consensus-based approach toward decision-making whereby
the top leader builds consensus around his specific policy proposals.

*Deng Xiaoping first articulated the need for the CCP to adopt a collective leadership system,
writing in 1980 that CCP leadership required radical reform to guard against the risk of overcon-
centration of power. Alice Miller, "What Would Deng Do?" Hoover Institution, February 14, 2017;
Deng Xiaoping, "On the Reform of the System of Party and State Leadership," 1980.

Achieving consensus can be difficult partly because members of the
Politburo Standing Committee may owe their position to political al-
legiance to different constituencies, interest groups, and influential
Party elders whose interests they informally represent.*14

| Women in China's Leadership† |
|----------------------------------|
| The emphasis on consensus building does not include the voice of women. Despite stated commitments to equal opportunity and fair representation by the CCP and the Chinese government,‡ women have limited representation and voice across the top echelons of China's political system.15 Historically, female representatives have rarely constituted more than 10 percent of the roughly 300-member CCP Central Committee.16 Only 6 women have ever served in the 25-member Politburo, half of whom were the wives of other top leaders.17 No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee or held any of the top three positions in China's political system: CCP general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), and state chairman.§18 Female representation in key government roles such as ministries and provincial governorships is also extremely low.19 The percentage of People's Liberation Army (PLA) servicemembers who are female is not publicly available, but a Chinese military newspaper estimated in 2015 that approximately 5 percent or fewer were women.20 Currently, no women hold senior command or political commissar positions in the PLA.21 |

Informal rules and procedures have emerged alongside a shift to
collective decision-making. These norms include mandatory retire-
ment age and term limits for CCP Politburo members, cadre eval-
uation systems, and regional representation in the CCP Central
Committee. Some analysts argue these norms have contributed to *Difficulties in consensus building extend throughout the broader Party-state bureaucracy. A
provincial Party secretary, for example, has the same bureaucratic rank in China's political sys-
tem as the minister of a State Council-level ministry. The interests and policy preferences of one
minister may correspond with or diverge from those of a broader array of other ministries and
local governments, with central Party leaders serving as the ultimate arbiters of decision-mak-
ing. As a result, decisions from the top are often interpreted in different ways by localities and
ministries, creating a "fragmented authoritarianism" style of governance in China's political
system. Kenneth Lieberthal, "Introduction: The 'Fragmented Authoritarianism' Model and Its
Limitations," in Kenneth Lieberthal and David Lampton, eds., Bureaucracy, Politics, and Deci-
sion Making in Post-Mao China, 1992, 1–30; David Lampton, "A Plum for a Peach: Bargaining,
Interest, and Bureaucratic Politics in China," in Kenneth Lieberthal and David Lampton, eds.,

‡PRC law on the protection of women's rights states that "women shall enjoy equal rights with
men in all aspects of political... life." China has also espoused a commitment to "strengthen[ing]
the work of training and selecting women cadres" and instituted quotas for female representation
in certain positions in the CCP. Valarie Tan, "Women Hold Up Half the Sky, but Men Rule the

§The top leader of the state in the PRC is called the "state chairman" (国家主席). Beijing
misleadingly translates this title as "president" for the English-speaking audience. The Chinese
word for "president" (总统), which is used in the title of the president of the United States and
other presidents in democratic countries, is not used in any of Xi's titles. Xinhua, "Xi Jinping

a more "institutionalized" political system in China.22 For example, expert on China's elite politics Cheng Li argues
that at least two loose factions* in the CCP leadership have created an "intraparty mechanism approximating a system of
checks and balances in the CCP leadership," with leaders of these two groupings alternating occupancy of top leadership
positions.23 Bruce Dickson, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University,
adds that existing and retired leaders negotiated over future leadership appointments in order to maintain a factional
balance of power.24

In reality, any apparent norms or institutions in China's political system are little more than flexible rules that do
not constrain the top CCP leaders but are instead selectively mobilized by them to advance their interests.25 For
example, while analysts point to formal and informal retirement age rules and term limits as indicative of
institutionalization of China's political system,† top CCP leaders have manipulated these norms to protect their
position. At the 15th Party Congress in 1997, then General Secretary Jiang Zemin imposed a mandatory retirement age on
the CCP leadership, and all leaders aged 70 or older resigned.26 This rule, issued in spite of the fact that then
General Secretary Jiang himself was 71, forced Qiao Shi, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and disliked by
Jiang, to retire.27 Then General Secretary Jiang lowered the retirement age to 67 at the 16th Party Congress in 2002 to
remove another political rival, Li Ruihuan.28

While these norms have always been informal and abused at the margins by his immediate predecessors, General Secretary
Xi has fully taken advantage of their informality to strengthen his control. He has proven more effective than Jiang
Zemin and Hu Jintao in preventing opposing factions from challenging his leadership, upsetting any prior trend toward
factional balancing. Whereas the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee of the 17th Party Congress (2007–2012)
featured four members of the Communist Youth League faction, the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee of the 19th
Party Congress (2017–2022) featured only one (Premier Li Keqiang).29

## Xi's Justification for Reasserting Party Control

Xi's drive to reassert the CCP's role in decision-making springs from what he perceived to be critical weaknesses in
China's governance capacity under his recent predecessors.30 A document known as a "historical resolution"‡ that Xi
directed in order to reinforce his own leadership ahead of the 20th Party Congress claims that "pre-
viously lax and weak governance" under his reform-era predeces-
sors had damaged the CCP's reputation, cohesiveness, and national
governance abilities.31 First, the document assesses that a "lack of
awareness" by the previous Party leadership had permitted "weak,
ineffective, diluted, and marginalized efforts in implementation" of
the Party's major policies and "feigned compliance" from lower-level
officials, jeopardizing the CCP's ability to enact its desired policies.32
Second, it argues that previous failures to stringently govern Par-
ty organizations had fostered "a serious lack of political conviction"
among Party members and officials as well as "a startling level of
corruption" that damaged the Party's public image and therefore
threatened its authority.33 In the economic sphere, the historical
resolution argues that an "undue emphasis on the rate and scale of
growth" since the beginning of "reform and opening up" had created
"institutional and structural problems in China's economy" that only
a strong Party could address.*34 In military affairs, it assesses that
weak Party control over the armed forces under recent leadership
had endangered both the Party's political security and China's mili-
tary effectiveness.35 Finally, it argues that China needs to bolster its
abilities to defend its national security and navigate an increasingly
complex international environment.36 The solution to all of these de-
ficiencies, in Xi's analysis, was strengthening Party leadership over
the organs of governance.37

*Dr. Li categorizes these factions as an "elitist coalition" of leaders from the families of CCP revolutionaries (e.g.,
Jiang Zemin, Xi Jinping) and a "populist" faction of leaders who advanced their careers by way of the Communist Youth
League and have oriented policy toward economic equality and regional development (Hu Jintao, Li Keqiang). The factional
groups Dr. Li identifies are not exhaustive, with several other loose groupings of political networks also observable in
China's elite politics. Cheng Li, Chinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era: Reassessing Collective Leadership, Brookings

2002, have worked to usher in new political leadership every 5–10 years. Damien Ma and Joshua Henderson, "Age Rules: The

important political issues of their time with bear-

Xi also justifies his own personal elevation as a means to strength-
en the overall authority of China's political leadership. Xuezhi Guo,
professor and chair of the political science department at Guilford
College, argues in his book The Politics of the Core Leader in Chi-
na that having a clear paramount leader facilitates penetration of
Party authority into society because the aura of unified leadership
fosters greater willingness to acquiesce to Party directives.38 It also
allows the leader to imprint the force of his personality on import-
ant policies.39 Party sources advance this argument by framing the
expansion of Xi's authority as beneficial for both Party unity and
China's overall future.† Chinese politics expert Alice Miller assessesing on their personal leadership and legacy. (For more on Xi's historical resolution, see Chapter 3,
Section 1: "Year in Review: Security and Foreign Affairs.") Bert Hofman, "China's Third Historical
Resolution: A Preview," National University of Singapore East Asian Institute, November 16, 2021,

2021.

*Deepening the integration of the CCP into China's administrative state bureaucracy aims
to overcome internal tensions in this domestic development agenda, such as the need to break
through vested interests and manage politically contentious redistributions of resources across
regions, income groups, and powerful sectors. Neil Thomas, written testimony for U.S.-China Eco-
nomic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party
Congress, January 27, 2022, 6; Neil Thomas, "Party All the Time: Xi Jinping's Governance Re-
form Agenda after the Fourth Plenum," MacroPolo, November 14, 2019; Nis Grunberg and Katja
Drinhausen, "The Party Leads on Everything," Mercator Institute for China Studies, September
24, 2019.

†A 2016 People's Daily editorial justifying Xi's political elevation asserted, "In order for a large
country and large party such as [China's] to cohere the entire party, unite the whole people, [and]
triumph over challenges... the CCP Central Committee and the whole Party must have a core." It
further describes Xi's adoption of this role as necessary for maintaining the authority of the CCP
Central Committee, the unified leadership of the Party, and China's overall long-term stability.
An authoritative article released by a media platform affiliated with the CCP's Central Political-
Legal Affairs Commission in March 2022 argues that "only a political party that has a strong core
can have formidable power" and supports this statement with quotations from Karl Marx, Friedrich
Engels, Mao Zedong, and Deng Xiaoping. It then credits Xi, serving as the core of the Party, with
enabling China to overcome serious challenges, both domestic and international. Central Political

that prior to Xi's rise in 2012, the CCP elite may have groomed him for the precise purpose of Party institution
building and shoring up governance capacity.* 40 In his testimony before the Commission, Neil Thomas, analyst for China
and Northeast Asia at consultancy Eurasia Group, similarly argued that a perception existed among CCP elites that Hu
Jintao's weak leadership had endangered Party authority and may have given Xi an "elite mandate" to restore the Party's
authority, which he has also used to consolidate his own power dramatically.41

## Xi's Lessons from the Fall of the Soviet Union

Xi's emphasis on reasserting Party control likely also reflects a desire to prevent the CCP from repeating mistakes he
believes contributed to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's (CPSU) fall from power and the ensuing collapse of the
Soviet Union itself. While Xi is not the first CCP leader to emphasize learning lessons from the fall of the Soviet
Union, his conclusions about which lessons to draw differ in some areas from those of his predecessors.42

A series of high-profile CCP propaganda documentaries on the topic produced in 2006, 2013, and 2022 illustrate this
difference. Although all three documentaries emphasize the dangers of corruption, media liberalization, and hostile
influences from outside powers, the 2006 documentary also includes a critique against overconcentration of power that is
noticeably absent from the two films produced under Xi.† 43 It criticizes the CPSU for repeatedly allowing the top
leader too much discretion to make decisions without consulting others.‡ 44 The 2013 and 2022 documentaries produced
under Xi do not share this assessment and instead place a pronounced emphasis on maintaining the authority of the
Party's top leader.45

† According to research by David Shambaugh, a similar critique of the over-centralization of power was also visible in
other Chinese assessments around and prior to this period. One of many themes common in works at the time was that
Stalin introduced an over-concentration of power and a "dictatorship of the supreme leader" which led to a range of
secondary problems throughout Soviet government and society. David Shambaugh, China's Communist Party: Atrophy and
Adaptation, Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2008, 62, 65–66.

‡ The documentary accuses most of the Soviet leaders for violating the poorly defined principle of "democratic

widespread problem of Party members "not speaking truth and currying favor[s]." Khrushchev and Brezhnev are similarly
chastised for restricting decision-making power to only a small group of individuals and neglecting intra-Party
oversight mechanisms. Gorbachev is accused of walking away from the principle of democratic centralism entirely through
a unilateral decision to force democratization upon the Soviet Union. ChinaScope, "Eight-Episode TV Documentary Series:

## Xi's Lessons from the Fall of the Soviet Union—Continued

According to Xi's remarks and propaganda aimed at the Party bureaucracy under his leadership, the most important factors
behind the Soviet collapse include ideological competition and confusion, loss of Party control over the historical narrative, decreasing effectiveness of the Party's organizational
structure, and loss of Party control over the military.46 Xi-era propaganda and both the 2013 and 2022 documentaries
feature an excerpt from a speech he delivered to the newly selected 18th Central Committee in January 2013, two months
after taking power:

> Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the CPSU fall from power? An important reason is that competition in
the ideological field was extremely intense; there was a complete negation of the Soviet Union's history [and] CPSU
history, negating of Lenin, negating of Stalin, engaging in historical nihilism; ideology [was] confused, each level of
Party organization had become almost useless, [and] the military was no longer under the leadership of the Party. . .
.This is a lesson from the past!47

The changes Xi has wrought on China's governance system align closely with this diagnosis of the CPSU's failures,
suggesting his agenda is informed in part by a desire to arrest these trends in China's own governance.48

## Features of CCP Decision-Making in the Xi Era

The CCP's decision-making under General Secretary Xi has broken away from the models of collective and consensus-based
decision-making developed over time during Deng, Jiang, and Hu's periods of rule. Xi has reversed these emerging
governance norms, overseeing an absorption of government functions once under the State Council into the CCP and
elevating his personal leadership in a manner not seen since Mao Zedong. He also emphasizes a broad conception of
national security in all policy areas so that the Party can address anything the leadership judges to be a threat. Xi's
sweeping anticorruption campaign complements these efforts by removing potential rivals, shoring up Party discipline,
and incentivizing loyalty to his leadership.

### Expanded CCP Decision-Making Power



*The phrase "top-level design" predates General Secretary Xi's rule over the CCP. According to Alex He, senior fellow at
the Centre for International Governance Innovation, the phrase was first introduced in recommendations prepared by the
CCP Central Committee for the 12th Five-Year Plan in October 2010: "It is necessary to comprehensively move reform
forward in every sector, with greater determination and courage; pay even more attention to a top-level design and an
overall plan for reform; and clarify the priorities and sequences for reform." Alex He, "Top-Level Design for Supremacy:
Economic Policy Making in China under President Xi," Centre for International Governance Innovation, May 2020, 3.

Xi is restructuring China's policymaking apparatus to grant greater decision-making authority to central Party bodies
across policy areas, including in some areas previously delegated to the State Council and other government bodies.49
Xi's elevation of "top-level design"* is emblematic of his push to increase the Party's control over policy formulation
and implementation in China's broader national development.50 Top-level design is intended to ensure more unified implementation of central policies throughout the system.51
By recentralizing policy formulation to Party-led organizations,
top-level design seeks to overpower vested interests and bureau-
cratic resistance to Xi's agenda.52 For Xi, this recentralization is
important because it enables him to overcome diverging interests of
State Council Ministries* and local governments that may hinder
their implementation of policy directives from the Party center.53

To bring this top-level design to fruition, Xi has increased the
number and bureaucratic power of Party leadership groups on core
policy topics. Between 2013 and 2018, Xi elevated the bureaucratic
status of existing Party leading small groups† on national securi-
ty, finance and economics, and foreign affairs by converting them
into permanent commissions.54 Compared to leading small groups,
commissions are higher-ranking, more formalized bodies with more
bureaucratic power to coordinate policy development.55 Xi also es-
tablished new Party groups on topics such as "comprehensively
deepening reform," "law-based governance," cybersecurity, audits,
and military-civil fusion, all of which were either founded as com-
missions or later elevated to that level.56 While some of these com-
missions' offices are located within the offices of the CCP Central
Committee, others have been physically placed within corresponding
State Council ministries.57 For example, in March 2018 the CCP
established a new Central Commission on Comprehensively Govern-
ing the Country According to Law with its own permanent offices at
the Ministry of Justice.58

March 2018 marked a key milestone in Xi's efforts to centralize
Party control. Following its Third Plenum in February 2018, the 19th
Central Committee under Xi's leadership released a plan in March
directing a broad reorganization of many elements of the Party-state
bureaucracy.59 This included the establishment and upgrading of six
of the aforementioned Party commissions as well as several other
measures that explicitly moved key functions from State Council
bodies under new Party leadership (see Table 1).60 The reorganiza-
tion plan published jointly by the CCP Central Committee and the
State Council emphasized the importance of furthering integration
between Party and state offices.61 It also explained that the changes
aimed to improve the CCP's ability to "design policy."62

†The CCP has used leading small groups since at least the 1950s for a variety of oversight
and decision-making purposes depending on the top leader's preferences. Under Mao Zedong, for
example, the Party Central Committee formed a five-person and then a ten-person leading small
group to guide the 1955 campaign to "suppress counterrevolutionaries." As the Party moved to a
collective leadership model with a consensus approach to decision-making, leading small groups
gradually became more policy focused and led by different members of the Politburo Standing
Committee. The CCP has also established task-oriented, short-term groups in response to policy
crises. On January 25, 2020, the Central Committee established a new central leading group on
pandemic response as CCP leaders finally publicly acknowledged the severity of the COVID-19
outbreak in Wuhan. Xinhua, "Xi Focus: Chronicle of Xi's Leadership in China's War against Coro-

## Anticorruption Campaign and Discipline Inspections as Tools of Governance

Upon assuming power in 2012, Xi launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign to both restore faith in the legitimacy of
the CCP and remove political rivals.63 The campaign has been notable in quickly reaching the upper echelons of the Party
and military leadership. Purges of several high-level officials have included former Secretary of the Central
Political-Legal Affairs Commission and member of the Politburo Standing Committee Zhou Yongkang and two former vice
chairmen of the CMC, among others.64 In targeting such officials, the campaign allowed Xi to increase his popular appeal
by rooting out egregious corruption of China's political elite.65 It also enabled Xi to sideline rivals and instill fear
of running afoul of his preferences throughout the Party's upper and lower ranks.66

The campaign and associated discipline inspections have been gradually institutionalized and now serve as tools to
ensure adherence to Xi's policy agenda across all levels of government. In late 2016, the CCP's Central Committee
launched pilot supervisory commissions in the Beijing municipality and Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces, leading to the
establishment of a National Supervisory Commission that integrated the anticorruption functions of several government
organizations.67 This commission ultimately joined with the Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI),
the CCP's top disciplinary body, at the 2018 Two Sessions.68 The new National Supervisory Commission formalized Xi's
anticorruption campaign and equipped the CCP with

## Anticorruption Campaign and Discipline Inspections as Tools of Governance—Continued

oversight of China's wider government bureaucracy and public officials, including non-Party members that were formerly
beyond the CCDI's jurisdiction.69 These increased intragovernmental and intraparty coordination efforts have been
complemented by changes to laws, regulations, and Party strictures to further formalize the campaign.70 The
anticorruption campaign's long-term persistence, expansion, and institutionalization provide increased evidence of its
underlying political motivation and Xi's intention to use it as a multipurpose governing tool.71

As Xi's efforts to root out corruption and bolster Party discipline become more formalized, investigations are reaching
down deeper into the Party's rank and file and becoming a means of governance. The number of corruption cases at or
below the county level grew nearly 20 percent from 523,000 in 2017 to 624,000 in 2021.72 According to think tank
MacroPolo's analysis of CCDI discipline inspections from 2019 to 2021, performance-related cases* made up 54 percent of
cases investigated, compared with 46 percent for financial corruption, suggesting the CCP is attempting to shape cadre
behavior to ensure they perform their duties.73 These shifts toward larger numbers of investigations into lower-level
cadres seem to point to an increased emphasis on ensuring broadbased responsiveness to the Party center.74 There is also
evidence that the ever-present threat of inspection has resulted in higher levels of risk aversion among local-level
bureaucrats.†

## Xi as the Core of CCP Decision-Making

Over the past decade, Xi has consolidated power and elevated his personal authority over the Party to an extent not seen
since Mao Zedong.75 First, Xi took control of the Party, state, and military more quickly than Jiang Zeming or Hu
Jintao, becoming CCP general secretary and chairman of the CMC in November 2012 and state chairman in March 2013.‡ Then
in 2016, only three years into Xi's

*The institutionalization of the National Supervision Commission within the CCDI is resulting in a more concerted effort
to modify cadre behavior and ensure they implement the top CCP leadership's policy agenda. Since 2018, the CCDI has
stressed the importance of "addressing bureaucratic inefficiency," with inspections now focusing on officials' failure
to implement Party directives or the adoption of a lax work style, such as holding too many meetings and side-stepping
administrative duties. Ruihan Huang and Joshua Henderson, "From Fear to Behavior Modification: Beijing Entrenches
Corruption Fight," MacroPolo, March 8, 2022.

†In a study on the anticorruption campaign's impact on local-level governance, Erik H. Wang, assistant professor of
political science at the Australian National University, found disciplinary inspections and anticorruption activities
made local-level bureaucrats more risk averse. Dr. Wang used local government land auctions as an indicator of local
bureaucrats' governance activity, as these auctions typically drive infrastructure development. According to Dr. Wang's
findings, provincial disciplinary inspections were followed in the subsequent month by a 15 percent decline in land
development projects proposed by bureaucrats in the inspected province. Erik H. Wang, "Frightened Mandarins: The Adverse
Effects of Fighting Corruption on Local Bureaucracy," Comparative Political Studies, October 16, 2021, 1–2, 10, 25–26.

‡Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao each served a whole term as the top leader of the Party and the state before their
predecessors (Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, respectively) ceded control of the military to them. Xi, by contrast,
attained leadership of the Party, military, and state each at the first available opportunity. National People's

first term, the 18th CCP Central Committee formally declared him the "core" of the Party.76 The designation of the
"core" is reserved for particularly influential top leaders in CCP politics, and prior to Xi, only Mao Zedong and Deng
Xiaoping had attained the title without it being directly bestowed upon them by the outgoing leader.*77 At the end of
Xi's first term in power, his namesake political theory "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
for a New Era" was incorporated into the Party Charter and the Preamble of the PRC Constitution, respectively, further
elevating him above his predecessors whose contributions to Party doctrine carry less political weight and drawing a
parallel with Mao's "Mao Zedong Thought."†78 In addition to formal political designations, Xi has accumulated informal
titles deeply reminiscent of those last used to refer to Mao Zedong‡ that, to the domestic audience, carry a clear
political message that places Xi on similar footing with Mao.79 They also elevate him above his other predecessors,
including Deng Xiaoping, who did not use any comparable honorifics.80

far received titles reminiscent of the latter three, although without the adjective "great" associated. Over the course
of Xi's tenure, state and Party media, government websites, and officials have variously referred to him as "Leader"
(lingxiu), "People's Leader" (renmin lingxiu), "Pilot at the Helm" (linghang zhangduo), "Helmsman" (zhangduozhe),

Xi's decision-making power has increased dramatically over this same period, to the point that CCP media have begun
alluding to his expanding role in the CCP's decision-making by recasting the previously negative term "decision by one
authority" as a positive feature of China's system.[^81] Most importantly, Xi has taken over the chairmanship of most of
the CCP's powerful commissions and leading small groups, granting him a guiding role in defining goals for most major
policy issues and expanding the remit of his decision-making power.[^82] Xi currently chairs nine Party commissions and
leading small groups, all but one of which were either elevated in status or created during his tenure (see Table
2).[^83] Hu Jintao, in comparison, chaired four.[^84] The head of each commission's staff office handles daily
administration for the commission and reports directly to Xi as the commission chairman.[^85]

Xi's elevated role is also reflected in other Party processes. For example, Xi has presided over the creation or
amendment of significantly more Party rules and regulations than his predecessors.87 In his testimony before the
Commission, Mr. Thomas estimated that Xi is responsible for creating or editing about 70 percent of current central
Party regulations, giving him an outsized impact on the overall governance of the CCP itself.*88 In 2021 alone, Xi
passed new CCP rules that increased central control over personnel selection, strengthened central supervision of
high-level cadres, and elevated the general secretary's control over the agenda, convening, and operations of the
Central Committee, Politburo, and Politburo Standing Committee.89 Xi also has significant ability to control very
high-level Party documents that carry great authority in China's ostensibly consensus-driven political system. According
to Party media, Xi personally directed and supervised the document drafting group for the 19th Central Committee's
Fourth Plenary Session in 2019 "from beginning to end" for more than 200 days.90

Xi's expansion of his own authority alongside concurrent efforts to strengthen Party control blurs the line between the
Party's authority and his own, creating conditions under which challenging him is tantamount to challenging the Party.
Some experts argue that the leadership of the Party is now personified in the personal leadership of Xi.91 For example,
Guoguang Wu, professor at the University of Victoria, Canada, remarks that the most striking feature of the 2019 Fourth
Plenum Xi personally supervised is "the parity of the leadership of the party, of the party center, and of the party
chief Xi Jinping."92 The line between Xi's authority and the Party's authority is also increasingly blurred in state
media.93 Mr. Thomas explains, "[Xi's] ideological control makes him virtually synonymous with Party rule ... rais[ing]
the public cost for elites to move against him."94 According to Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College, rule changes under Xi have also "systematically enshrined Xi's personal authority and made support for and
loyalty to Xi's authority a litmus test to determine discipline violations, job performance, and appointments and
promotions of officials."95 A condition to maintain Xi's status as the core and the center of the entire Party is now
included in the CCP's Disciplinary and Penalty Code, Inspection and Work Code, CCP and Government Cadre Evaluation Code,
and Cadre Appointment and Promotion Code.96 Support for Xi even appears to be a criterion for participation in the
upcoming 20th Party Congress.†97

*Xi has also amassed the political power to alter more authoritative rules than his predecessors in a way that further
entrenches his own power. For example, in 2016 Xi oversaw the revision of Several Principles on Political Life in the
Party, one of the core documents developed under Deng Xiaoping to prevent the return of Mao-era strongman rule. The
revised document notably decreased the emphasis on "collective leadership" and watered down prohibitions against the
promotion of a personality cult. Minxin Pei, "Rewriting the Rules of the Chinese Party-State: Xi's Progress in
Reinvigorating the CCP," China Leadership Monitor, June 1, 2019, 1–5.

†After the November 2021 Sixth Plenum, CCP media began emphasizing that delegates selected for the upcoming 20th Party
Congress must "firmly uphold General Secretary Xi Jinping's core position in both the Party's Central Committee and the
Party as a whole." Neil Thomas, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP
Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 11.

## The "Two Safeguards" and the "Two Establishes"

Xi has used a pair of political formulations known as the "Two Safeguards" and "Two Establishes" to enshrine his status
in official Party documents and to build a political defense for his personal leadership. In the runup to the 20th Party
Congress, the two formulations have served as a vehicle for expressing obeisance to Xi in public statements by officials
and organizations of the Party, government, and military at both central and provincial levels.^98

- The Two Safeguards, introduced in early 2018, stipulate that the CCP must "safeguard General Secretary Xi Jinping's
position as the core of the CCP Central Committee and the core of the whole Party" and "safeguard the CCP Central
Committee's authority and centralized, unified leadership."^99 The Two Safeguards were incorporated into the CCP
Regulations on Disciplinary Actions on August 26, 2018, making them a powerful tool for enforcing political loyalty to
Xi.^100

- The Two Establishes build on the foundation of the Two Safeguards while taking steps toward greater personalization of
power,* declaring that the Party has "established Comrade Xi Jinping's status as the core of the CCP Central Committee
and the core of the whole Party" and "established the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era."^101 Though first mentioned in 2018, the Two Establishes have been most heavily promoted
since their incorporation into the 19th Central Committee's Sixth Plenum Communique and Xi's historical resolution in
November 2021.^102

## Emphasis on National Security in All Policy Areas

Xi has embedded a broad definition of "national security" into decision-making in nearly every policy area (see "Xi's
'Comprehensive National Security Concept'" below), which complements his emphasis on coordinated, centralized
leadership.^103 Since 2014, the CCP claims to have made "security development a common thread in every domain of
national development," and the majority of Party and state organs now directly support some aspect of China's so-called
"national security work."^104 As Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at RAND Corporation, explained
in 2015, the adjustment means "anything [CCP] authorities deem an impediment to the realization of any of the country's
developmental objectives—regardless of whether it is economic, political or another category—may now be deemed a
'security threat.'"^105

----

*While only one of the Two Safeguards mentions Xi by name, both of the Two Establishes concern him directly.
Additionally, while the Two Safeguards refer to the leader by his current position as "General Secretary Xi Jinping,"
the Two Establishes refer to him as "Comrade Xi Jinping," thereby promoting him as an individual with authority
independent of his particular position in the Party apparatus. Qiushi, "Read and Understand the Decisive Significance of
the 'Two Establishes'" (读懂"两个确立"的决定性意义), January 10, 2022. Translation; Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist

## Xi's "Comprehensive National Security Concept"

Xi has introduced a so-called "Comprehensive National Security Concept"* that argues that threats to the CCP regime may
originate from any field in the domestic or international arena and that these threats require coordinated, proactive
efforts to manage. Its introduction in 2014 heralded a dramatic broadening and elevation of the concept of national
security within China's policy framework.106 As Sheena Chestnut Greitens, associate professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson
School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, testified before the Commission, the concept is primarily
concerned with threats to the security of the CCP regime and political system.107 According to official descriptions, it
covers a wide and expanding range of policy areas within the definition of national security.108 To date, this includes
at least political security, military security, territorial security, economic security, cultural security, societal
security, scientific security, internet security, environmental security, resource security, nuclear security, security
of overseas interests, space security, deep sea security, polar security, and biological security.† 109 The concept
considers both internal and external threats in each of these areas as well as the potential for the two types of
threats to interact with and exacerbate one another.110 It further emphasizes the importance of proactive efforts to
neutralize threats before they cause lasting damage.111

To better coordinate the expansion of security responsibilities throughout the bureaucracy, Xi has strengthened central
control by creating the Central National Security Commission (CNSC) and its associated hierarchy.112 Xi presided over
the creation of the CNSC in 2014 by elevating the previously ad hoc Central National Security Leading Small Group to the
status of a permanent commission, thereby granting it a permanent staff office, a regular membership, and a position of
greater influence within the bureaucracy.113 Since 2014, the CNSC has served as the CCP Central Committee's official
"coordinating mechanism for decision-making and discussion" on the broad range of issues now deemed "national security"
affairs and the institutional manifestation of Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept.114 It functions as the
highest decision-making body for integrated national security issues, merging the bureaucratic stove-

pipes of national security work through its inclusion of top political,
military, and economic leaders.* 115 An official readout of the CNSC's
first meeting states that the group exists "to establish a centralized,
unified, efficient, and authoritative national security system; and to
strengthen the leadership of national security work."116 This body
is responsible to the Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee
and is chaired by Xi himself.117 A hierarchy of subordinate national
security commissions have also been integrated into the Party struc-
ture at the provincial, prefectural, municipal, district, and county
levels.118 These lower-level commissions take direction from above
and are mainly tasked with implementation,† creating a system of
supervision and coordination that extends from Xi in his role as
CNSC chairman to the localities.119

## Consequences for CCP Decision-Making in the Xi Era

The recentralization of the CCP's decision-making power under
Xi streamlines policy coordination in China while undermining the
flexibility of lower-level bodies and contributing to other policy chal-
lenges. Consequences arising from this recentralization include:

- Centralized decision-making encourages further reliance on
campaign-style governance, which is ill-suited to addressing lon-
ger-term, structural challenges: As a Leninist party, the CCP is
inherently mobilizational and often formulates and implements
policy in a campaign-style manner.120 Campaigns are appealing
because in demanding rapid and clear results, they can over-
come bureaucracy and give the impression of responsiveness to
policy problems.121 By increasing the system's responsiveness to
centralized directives, Xi's streamlining of the system increases
the attractiveness of the mobilizational approach to policy for-
mulation. Mr. Thomas testified that a mobilizational approach
can yield results in policy areas with short-term, measurable,
and easily defined goals, such as the improvement of air quality
in China's industrial northeast.122 Campaign-style governance
is less effective in resolving longer-term structural challenges
such as China's economic slowdown, declining productivity, and
high debt levels, which require careful balancing between dif-

ferent stakeholders, including central and local government of-
ficials and state and nonstate businesses.123

• Centralized decision-making reduces flexibility in local-level gov-
ernance, a historically important source of regime resilience: In
testimony before the Commission, Middlebury College associate
professor of political science Jessica Teets explained that the
previous encouragement and tolerance of local-level experimen-
tation and adaptation of central-level policy directives enabled
the CCP to maintain broad-based support for its rule.* 124 Lo-
cal experimentation has also encouraged provinces to calibrate
their tax and investment regulations to compete for investment
from private and foreign firms.125

• Xi's centralization of political power and decision-making in the
CCP and himself makes it difficult to correct policy mistakes:
As Xi has consolidated power within CCP bodies and himself,
the Party's policy choices increasingly reflect his personal judg-
ment with minimal if any checks from other parts of the Par-
ty-state bureaucracy.126 Concentrating policy formulation and
decision-making in leading small groups and commissions per-
sonally led by Xi means cadres also become fearful of adjusting
and implementing policy in any manner that might run counter
to the general secretary's pronouncements.127

## Economic Decision-Making

Like other domains, economic policymaking under General Sec-
retary Xi has been characterized by increasing centralization. The
economic domain is unique, however, in the degree to which decen-
tralization and devolution of economic decisions had become core
features of China's economy prior to Xi's ascension. In contrast to
speculation at the beginning of his term that Xi might accentuate
these trends as a market-oriented reformer, he has rather proven

a wealthy province along China's eastern seaboard, for example, pledged in its provincial 14th
Five-Year Plan to "implement renewable energy replacement [of fossil energy]," invoking Xi's call
from March 2021 to "establish a new type of power system with new energy as the mainstay."
"New energy" in CCP policy pronouncement often refers to recently developed energy generation
technologies such as wind and solar power as opposed to traditional fossil or hydrogeneration
technologies. Jessica Teets, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Com-

influence globally.* 129 To accomplish this, Xi is reviving, enhancing, and building new levers of central control over
China's sprawling economy.

## The Fragmentation of Economic Decision-Making Prior to the Xi Era

In the decades preceding Xi, decentralization and devolution of economic decision-making came to characterize China's
political economy. "Fragmented authoritarianism" became a widely used term to describe the sprawling nature of China's
economic bureaucracy, which consists of two vertical hierarchies, the Party (e.g., Party committees) and the state
(e.g., ministries), intermeshed with territorial-level governments (e.g., mayors) and replicated at five levels:
central, provincial, county, city, and township. Around the period of China's Reform and Opening, the prominence and
discretion of local implementation increased sizably.† As Dr. Teets argued in testimony before the Commission, the great
strength of this model was the adaptability it afforded an otherwise rigid authoritarian state. Local governments were
able to compete, innovate, and move quickly to encourage GDP growth.130

The problem CCP leaders perceived, however, was that their formal control over economic decision-making had eroded.
Halting attempts to adjust the growth model under the Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao Administration highlighted conflicts
between the central government, local governments, and emerging corporate class.131 Inability to push forward central
directives also revealed the relative decline of Party control mechanisms as well as rampant corruption and state
capture by networks of regime insiders.132 Vested interest groups across various sectors (e.g., real estate,
infrastructure, finance, and energy) and geographic areas developed centers of power challenging Beijing. Characterized
by informal patronage and loyalty networks, these blocs proved capable of influencing national politics and stymying
central government initiatives in favor of parochial interests.‡ While this collusion between local governments and
business may have fostered China's rapid growth, it undermined the effectiveness of central governance, often requiring
Beijing to bargain informally with influential interest groups in exchange for compliance with top-level decisions.133
As vested interests undermined

*As Neil Thomas explained in testimony before the Commission, "For Xi, political power also has a policy purpose. Xi is
not a simple megalomaniac. His personalist rule is an effort to 'concentrate power to do big things.'" Neil Thomas,
written testimony for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the
20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 4.

†Some analysts and scholars identify the centralization versus decentralization paradigm as the perpetual source of both
development and conflict in authoritarian systems, as a "continuous struggle" and "mutual interdependence" of a
"despotic, universal state" contends with "a decentralized, particularistic aristocracy in actual possession of much of
the power infrastructure of society." Mark Lupher, "Power Restructuring in China and Russia," Westview Press, 1996, 10.
As an example of this struggle within China, following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, China was
originally governed via six greater administrative areas, all headed by powerful revolutionaries. However, this system
was abolished quickly in the 1950s in favor of smaller provincial governance units, as Mao feared that large local power
bases were a mounting challenge to central authority. Xiao Ma, "Localized Bargaining," Oxford University Press, 2022,
194.

‡A recent insider-turned-defector's account of this process is captured in Desmond Shum's book Red Roulette, wherein the
author demonstrates the informal networks of wealth and influence that proliferated in the Hu-Wen era involving intimate
members of Premier Wen Jiabao's own family, high-ranking Party personnel, private businessmen, and a variety of other
elites. In one chapter, Shum reveals that he, a non-Party member, was able to influence the promotion track of several
cadres. Desmond Shum, Red Roulette, Simon & Schuster, September 7, 2021.

the Party internally, sources of wealth and influence outside the
Party structure also rose precipitously, leading to the rapid relative
decline in importance of the Party's formal control mechanisms.134
Increasingly aware of their dwindling influence, CCP leaders came
to view economic decentralization and fragmentation of authority as
a threat to their rule. Thus, while many within and outside China
saw liberalizing market-oriented reforms—moves that would have
promoted transparency, increased bottom-up input and accountability, and decreased the role of regime insiders over the
economy—as
the solution to increasingly obvious systemic defects, CCP leaders
opted instead for top-down reform, revivifying the Party's influence
over the economy.

## Power and Preservation Motivate Centralized Economic Decision-Making in the Xi Era

General Secretary Xi came into power with a mandate to preserve and recentralize the Party's authority, increase
compliance
with top-level economic directives throughout the Party-state bureaucracy, and crack down on vested interests.135 At the
highest
levels, agreement was reached that reform from above via hierarchical, formal, Leninist Party structures was crucial to
the Party's
preservation. Xi's efforts are thus oriented around subjecting economic decision-makers to strict adherence to his
"top-level design
approach."136 As Xi elaborated in a speech at the Fifth Plenum of
the 19th Central Committee in October 2020, his "new development
dynamic" is intended to "strengthen planning and design at the
top level, and delegate detailed tasks to lower levels with priorities
assigned."137 Xi's approach is intended to counter the fragmented
nature of the economic system that had arisen in the decades prior to his rule, in particular aiming to weaken centers
of economic
influence inside and outside the Party-state system that complicate
or undermine his top-level direction. As Dr. Teets addressed in testimony before the Commission, this represents a
decisive—though
as of yet incomplete—move toward a new type of economic model
wherein the center exerts greater control and the localities have
far less autonomy.138 Xi notes his intentions for consolidating and
centralizing in his Fifth Plenum speech, arguing that his "new development dynamic must be built upon a unified national
market,
not on small and fragmented local markets."139

In addition to Party preservation, Xi's drive to centralize control
over the economy is motivated and justified in terms of engineering a comprehensive modernization drive to augment
China's national power and global influence, particularly vis-à-vis the United
States.* 140 The Party's evolving economic development ambitions

*In a speech given shortly after becoming general secretary in 2013, Xi outlined his guiding
motivation: "we must concentrate our efforts on bettering our own affairs, continually broadening
our comprehensive national power, improving the lives of our people, building a socialism that
is superior to capitalism, and laying the foundation for a future where we will win the initiative
and have the dominant position." In the third volume of Governance of China, Xi explains that a
"well-founded system is the biggest strength a country has, and competition in terms of systems
is the most essential rivalry between countries." Beijing's nationalist pursuit of "the great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation" is routinely framed as part of this broad competition of systems,
particularly with the United States, and it is in turn used to justify the need for strengthening
the Party and enhancing its position over and within the economy. For more, see U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission, Chapter 1, Section 1, "A Global Contest for Power and
Influence: China's Views of Strategic Competition with the United States," in 2020 Annual Report

are rhetorically and practically connected with the preservation of its domestic political position as well as its
ability to exert global influence. Xi and his authorized propaganda regularly promote the idea that the Party is
uniquely capable—informed by allegedly scientific assessments stemming from its Marxist analytic framework—of leading
China and its economy to what he calls the "great rejuvenation." 141 Barry Naughton, China economist at the University
of California at San Diego, succinctly captures Beijing's evolving approach to its economy as a process of "grand
steerage." 142 At the 19th Party Congress, Xi introduced a new and expedited timetable for bolstering China's so-called
"comprehensive national power" by way of having "basically achieved modernization" by 2035. 143 For Xi, achieving these
expedited modernization goals simultaneously requires and justifies centralization, unity, and disciplined adherence to
top-level economic directives. The CCP's preservation and reinvigoration is thus, at least in Xi's assessment, in a
symbiotic relationship with his modernization goals and his ambitious vision for global leadership.

Xi's confident pursuit and enunciation of his nationalistic modernization plans, however, coexist uneasily with the
stark reality of an unbalanced economy that has experienced extended overreliance on unproductive debt. Misallocated
resources have led total factor productivity growth (an economist's primary measure of economic efficiency) to drop
precipitously from an average of 3.5 percent in the 2000s to only 0.7 percent in the 2010s, at the same time total debt
has ballooned. 144 It is increasingly evident to those inside and outside Beijing that a decisive economic slowdown is
unavoidable and happening. These unwelcomed realities have only added urgency to Xi's centralization drive as he seeks
to make a virtue out of necessity: concentrating control to not only cut off local governments and vested interests from
piling up debts in unproductive sectors but also steer resource allocation in centrally approved directions. As Beijing
deepens a belated effort to cut off credit to old growth drivers, principally real estate construction activities, these
moves have become embedded in a larger, politicized effort to shift China's growth model from "quantity" to "quality,"
wherein investment is channeled in accordance with a top-down definition of "quality" that conspicuously serves Xi's
modernization drive. Centralization and the revivification of top-down control mechanisms simultaneously aim to
strengthen Xi's capacity to guide this process and to ensure the regime's preservation amid potential economic
instability.

## Politicized Economic Decision-Making Replaces GDP Growth Maximization—Continued

growth model to "high-quality" innovation-driven growth.* External observers initially expressed optimism that reducing
a singular emphasis on growth would cut back on the negative externalities of China's model. In practice, however,
deemphasizing GDP growth as the lynchpin of economic decision-making has had the opposite effect, greatly increasing the
politicization of economic decision-making as the CCP takes a top-down approach to determining what constitutes
high-quality growth. Numerical targets often allowed officials and enterprises leeway to experiment in how they
fulfilled state-directed objectives. GDP targets, however, have been replaced by a "confusing welter of political,
social, and environmental mandates," according to Andrew Batson, director for China research at economic research firm
Gavekal. The shift has led officials and enterprises to adhere more closely to signals from Beijing than the market.¹⁴⁵
Rather than liberal market reform, Xi's "grand project to reorient the Communist Party's mobilizational machinery away
from the pursuit of economic growth and toward a broader set of goals, which can be summarized as the pursuit of
'national greatness' " is instead far more "consistent with Xi's renewed focus on ideology and political discipline."¹⁴⁶

## The Structures of Economic Decision-Making under Xi

Xi is revivifying formal Leninist structures to discipline and control lower-level economic decision-making, enforce
adherence to central directives, deepen the Party's penetration into all aspects of the economy, and expand and deploy
macroeconomic policy planning and guidance. Structures of economic decision-making under Xi can be segmented into two
areas: (1) discipline, command, and control of the Party and state bureaucracies; and (2) increased penetration and
efforts to steer the nonstate sector. Xi aims to overcome the structural challenge of exerting control over a sprawling
economic system, enormous geographical expanse, and massive population by conditioning the bureaucracy, local officials,
state-owned enterprises, and—increasingly—nonstate actors to faithfully enact his nationalist modernization plans. Xi's
address to the 19th Party Congress stressed the importance of developing the Party so the Party can guide the country
and the economy toward modernization.¹⁴⁷ This belief will continue to animate Xi's agenda at and beyond the 20th Party
Congress.

*The 19th Party Congress was the locus of a major change in this direction, as Xi altered the CCP's "principal
contradiction" facing Chinese society away from Deng's "ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people and
backward social production" and to his own "unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs
for a better life." As Neil Thomas explained in his testimony, this change in the "principal contradiction" is an arcane
but extremely important aspect of China's governance. Neil Thomas, written testimony for the U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 5–6.

# Reconsolidating the Control Center: The Party-State's Economic Bureaucracy

Whereas Mao Zedong was broadly "[d]istrustful of bureaucracy" and "sought means of administration which minimized the
role of bureaucracy," Xi seeks to rule through the bureaucracy, increasing its conditioning and adherence to central
directives so that it may be harnessed and relied upon to faithfully steward his top-down economic program.148

## Centralizing Economic Decision-Making Power through Institutional Restructuring

The ability of central leaders to restructure both Party and state institutions is a major source of power.149
Concentration of economic decision-making within Party commissions, and the expansion in resources and institutional
capacity of these bodies, provides Xi greater leverage to penetrate and guide the state bureaucracies responsible for
carrying out economic policy and ensure they are responsive to his top-level design.* By moving decision-making to these
commissions, Xi has shifted the locus of economic decision-making out of the Politburo Standing Committee and to himself
and his coterie of loyalists that run the economic commissions. Xi has also empowered Party organs he more directly
controls to reclaim command over economic policymaking and implementation processes that had devolved to the State
Council, enabling his influence over economic policy to far outpace that of Li Keqiang who, as premier of the State
Council, would historically have had more power over economic matters.† 150

The two most important Party entities for economic policy-making in China, both upgraded from leading small groups to
commissions in March 2018, are the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and
Economic Affairs Commission.151 The former, although not principally focused on economics, is nonetheless the most
important commission impacting economic policy. Nis Grünberg, lead analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies
and an expert on China's governance, called the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission the "powerhouse for
Xi Jinping's 'top-level design' policymaking, issuing policy on a broad array of topics, including economic issues."152
The Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission outranks ministries and commands more political clout than
China's State

*Resources and personnel were syphoned away from functional ministries to staff these now expanded bodies, likely
leading to "larger permanent staff and even their own office buildings." Victor Shih, written testimony for the
U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January
27, 2022, 2.

†Prior premiers, such as Zhu Rongji, have been given the latitude to oversee momentous economic policy programs,
including banking system reorganization and state-owned enterprise reform. Beyond the structural changes, recent Party
proceedings further point to the sidelining of the State Council and its leadership in matters of economic affairs. Li
Keqiang was notably not referred to as "Premier" in the readout of the CCP's 2021 Central Economic Work Conference,
whereas he was in the 2020 readout. Xinhua, "The Central Economic Work Conference Was Held in Beijing, Xi Jinping and Li
Keqiang Delivered Important Speeches, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji, and Han Zheng All Attended the
Meeting" (中央经济工作会议在北京举行 习近平李克强作重要讲话 栗战书汪洋王沪宁赵乐际韩正出席会议), December 10, 2021. Translation; Xinhua, "Central Economic Work

Council, which it uses "to steer and accelerate structural reforms under guidance by the central leadership," and it
includes but is not limited to economic policymaking areas such as "structural reforms in the financial sector, market
regulation, and trade policy."[^153] The Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission formulates policies and
hierarchically guides subordinate functional bodies such as the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance, the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Science and
Technology, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.[^154] The Central Finance and Economic Affairs
Commission, as the second-most-important economic policymaking body, fulfills a similar role but with a more specialized
remit focusing specifically on finance and economics, and it is "not as involved in the concrete policy formulation as
the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission."[^155]

The most noteworthy downgrading of state power at the expense of the Party's recentralization of economic policymaking
may be the de facto demotion of the National Development and Reform Commission (formerly the State Planning
Commission)†, an entity of the state government once so powerful it was known as the "mini State Council."[^156] In the
Hu-Wen era, the State Council guided China's economic development, with the National Development and Reform Commission
leading coordination of the national five-year planning process and making relevant policy decisions.[^157] Under Xi,
the Party-led commissions identified above have taken on more of these responsibilities at the same time as the 2018
restructuring removed key economic policymaking areas from the commission's jurisdiction, further curtailing its
influence.‡ The National Development and Reform Commission remains the leading state body for macroplanning and still
conducts preliminary five-year planning research at the direction of the Politburo and the Central Committee, presenting
them with initial policy proposals. The Party's Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission, however, now
coordinates the drafting of the actual five-year plan and makes relevant decisions on its content.[^159] Centralized
economic decision-making power in Party bodies that are more pliant to Xi's commands and increasingly resourced and
empowered to steer China's economic bureaucracy demonstrate Xi's desire to ensure greater compliance with his top-level
directives.

[^*] In recent years, significant economic policies were made by the State Council, but they needed to be discussed and
approved by the Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee. In the late 1970s, during the transition away from Maoism,
the CCP authorized the State Council to manage day-to-day administration of the country. Alex He, "The Emerging Model of

and Reform Commission. Peter Martin, "The Humbling of the NDRC: China's National Development and Reform Commission

## Increasing Supervision and Control of Local Experimentation beyond the 20th Party Congress

Despite Xi's centralization drive, economic policy implementation of top-level directives retains decentralized
features. The reasons for this are structural, pragmatic, and strategic. Structurally, given China's geographic and
population size, central leaders have little choice but to rely on local-level implementation of their plans.
Pragmatically, central leaders continue to derive utility from local governments and officials figuring out what
high-level directives such as "supply-side structural reform" should mean in practice. By passing responsibility to
local levels, the central government puts the onus of resource expenditure on them while preserving its own resources.
Further, the center can actively promote the specific implementation solutions that work well at the local level.
Strategically, the central government is able to shift blame onto local governments whenever anything goes wrong. As Ran
Ran and Yan Jian, scholars of Chinese politics, explain, "Upper level Chinese officials are inclined to deflect the
blame downward to those at the lower levels who are in a less powerful position in the administrative system."¹⁶⁰ All of
these factors enable Xi to take credit when things go right, blame others when things go wrong, and allow those below
him to do the difficult work of trying to implement vague and contradictory top-level guidance.

Dr. Teets emphasized in testimony before the Commission, however, that policy experimentation in the Xi era is
increasingly "supervised," with digital governance tools augmenting the center's ability to "directly monitor local
compliance."¹⁶¹ This has led the governance structure to become "less fragmented between Party and State, and between
the central and local levels of government, removing much of the previous policy discretion in the system."¹⁶² While
reduced local discretion has benefits related to better implementation, less corruption, and more mobilization and
standardization capacity, Xi's changes to governance have also led to confusion and frustration among cadres who face
less clarity on promotion prospects, a sense of paralysis, and decreasing morale.¹⁶³ Centralization and
bureaucratization remain ongoing processes and are far from complete, but the shift to this style of governance will
increasingly endure "the same problems that all rigid bureaucracies do: less innovation to solve local problems,
inadequacy of "one-size-fits-all policies," challenges of collecting enough information, and of regulating elite
ambition within the system."¹⁶⁴ Nonetheless, Dr. Teets assesses that through the 20th Party Congress and beyond, "Xi
Jinping's belief that the Party-state system was facing existential threats under the previous system makes any
deviation from political centralization unlikely."*¹⁶⁵

*Optimistically, Dr. Teets forecasts that as "power accrues to the Party leadership and former veto players are pushed
out of the system, we will observe policy reform in traditionally challenging areas, such as the urbanization-household
registration nexus, advanced economic reform, and land reform. In the past, these reforms were not feasible because
local or factional leaders opposed them, but now these changes may be made." Jessica Teets, written testimony for
U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January
27, 2022, 4.

# Placing, Promoting, and Rewarding Personnel in the Economic Domain: Xi's Network of Loyalists

Building and placing networks of loyalists in key domains is one of the most important aspects of control in the CCP's
Leninist system. In the sprawling economic domain in particular, wherein numerous technical issue areas make it
impossible for one individual to track everything at the center let alone at the localities, Xi relies on a coterie of
loyalists to carry out his will. Xi leans heavily on the CCP's Central Organization Department, a powerful Party organ
that directly monitors, evaluates, and controls promotions for thousands of positions throughout the Party system, thus
making it an immensely important institution to Xi's plans for economic grand steerage as well for the millions of
cadres seeking promotion into positions of prominence.* The Organization Department's influence has only increased since
2018, when the State Administration of Civil Service, which formerly handled the appointment and assignment of state
officials, was abolished and its functions absorbed into the Organization Department.¹⁶⁶ Xi has filled the Organization
Department's leadership role, effectively his "chief personnel officer," with close associate Chen Xi, who was his
roommate and close friend as a fellow "worker-peasant-soldier student" at Tsinghua University, when they both studied
the same subject (chemical engineering) at the same time (1975–1979).¹⁶⁷ Control over the Organization Department allows
Xi not only to promote loyalists to any position within the "leading cadre system," including the heads of the
provincial organization departments, but also to embed his preferred economic promotion metrics into the evaluation
criteria leading cadres compete to meet, mobilizing China's personnel apparatus to further his own politically informed
economic development agenda.¹⁶⁸

Xi's loyalists are also perched atop the key "comprehensive" economic decision units, namely those that are more
important than specific functional bureaucracies. Most important in this regard is Liu He, who handles the relevant
economic issues at both the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic
Affairs Commission. Liu, as with Chen Xi, is a close associate from Xi's youth.¹⁶⁹ In the state bureaucracy, Xi also
placed He Lifeng, one of his closest associates dating back to their time in Fujian in the 1980s, at the head of the
National Development and Reform Commission.¹⁷⁰ He could become Xi's top economic advisor, according to reporting from
the Wall Street Journal, taking over for Liu and overseeing day-to-day economic work at the Central Comprehensively
Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission.¹⁷¹ Liu is over the implicit
retirement age and, if the implicit norm holds, would vacate these positions at the 20th Party Congress.¹⁷²

*The leading cadre system is estimated to contain over two million positions, with roughly 2,500 at the
provincial/ministerial level. Cadre evaluation has also become substantially more centralized over time, with the
Organization Department promulgating a variety of more specific metrics, the provinces more closely monitoring the
counties, and the center more closely monitoring the provinces for compliance. Rui Qi, Chenchen Shi, and Mark Wang, "The

## Controlling, Disciplining, and Punishing Personnel in the Economic Domain: Fear as a Tool

While placement and promotion incentives are a key lever Xi uses to induce compliance with his economic agenda, he has
an equally potent counterpart in his arsenal: discipline and punishment. Christopher Carothers, postdoctoral fellow at
the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Study of Contemporary China and an expert on Xi's anticorruption
campaign, has documented the rise of inspections and their transition from "corruption control to everything control."
173 Dr. Carothers argues that the "Xi administration initially strengthened inspections to combat corruption but then
repurposed them to serve as a top-down governance mechanism in numerous other areas as well," including implementation
of Xi's economic development initiatives. 174 Investigations and inspections have become tools to coerce a
geographically and functionally fragmented and decentralized bureaucracy and group of local elites into compliance with
top-down economic decisions. 175 Dr. Carothers notes that these visits "produce a great deal of fear among bureaucrats
and businesspeople," as inspectors' determinations, which are increasingly focused on substantively monitoring policy
implementation, can have "swift and dramatic consequences." 176 As in other domains, Xi relies in particular on the
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the National Supervisory Commission—both of which are headed by
Xi loyalists—to enforce implementation of central economic decisions.* 177

Xi's much-touted campaign to eliminate absolute poverty† in China is a prominent example of the involvement of these
commissions in disciplining lower-level decision-makers and implementers. The National Supervisory Commission and CCDI
worked at Xi's personal instruction to pressure and closely monitor Party and government officials to enact his
campaign-style poverty reduction efforts, investigating and disciplining more than 99,000 people in 2019 for corruption
related to poverty alleviation efforts. 178 More recently, investigations have been ongoing into leaders in areas
related to China's flagging technological upgrading ambitions. Xiao Yaqing, responsible for overseeing industrial policy
initiatives in semiconductors and other high-technology areas as the Minister of Industry and Information Technology,
was removed from his post as minister in July 2022 and placed under investigation for a "violation of discipline and
law," making him the highest-ranking official ensnared

----

*The head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Zhao Leji, is considered one of Xi's two closest allies
on the Politburo Standing Committee. The head of the National Supervisory Commission, Yang Xiaodu, served with Xi in
Shanghai and was a deputy of Wang Qishan for several years prior to his appointment in March 2018. Neil Thomas, "Ties
That Bind: Xi's People on the Politburo," MacroPolo, June 17, 2020; US-China Business Council, "National Supervisory
Commission Director Yang Xiaodu"; Matt Ho, "Xi Jinping Aide, Yang Xiaodu, to Head China's Anti-Corruption 'Super
Agency,' " South China Morning Post, March 18, 2018.

†When Xi declared victory over absolute poverty in 2021, China's standard for "absolute poverty" was roughly $2.30 per
day in 2011 dollars after adjusting for purchasing power parity. While this exceeded the World Bank's extreme poverty
threshold of $1.90 in 2011 dollars, economists have argued that the standard is nevertheless too low for a country with
China's aggregate wealth. For more on limits of the metrics, methodology, and accuracy of the CCP's assertion of victory
over absolute poverty, see Chapter 1, Section 1, "The Chinese Communist Party's Ambitions and Challenges at Its
Centennial" in U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 39;

since 2018.179 Between June and August 2022, the president and head of the National Integrated Circuit Industry
Investment Fund, China's largest semiconductor government guidance fund, and four other top executives were put under
investigation.180 These investigations send a strong signal and warning to the rest of the bureaucracy and those charged
with implementing Xi's technological upgrading ambitions that he is not pleased with the progress.

## CCP Investigates Major Financial Institutions to Ensure Political Fealty

CCP leaders are increasing scrutiny of state financial regulators and major financial institutions to ensure adherence
to the Party's top-level economic policy decisions. In October 2021, the CCP Central Committee announced it would
undertake a series of disciplinary inspections into China's financial regulators, state-owned banks, and major financial
institutions, with a statement from the CCDI describing the inspections as part of an effort to "strengthen the Party's
leadership of financial work."181 The probe began as questions about China's high debt levels and inability to shift
toward its "high-quality" growth model came into sharper relief for China's leaders: the 2021 CCDI investigation was
notable for its inclusion of China's state-owned asset management companies, such as China Huarong.182 The firm's
chairman, Lai Xiaomin, was executed following his conviction on bribery charges in January 2021.183 Lai's execution was
followed by Huarong missing a deadline to release its 2020 Annual Report in April 2021, further rattling China's
financial markets.*184 Asset management companies were not scrutinized in a prior round of CCDI inspections into China's
financial sector in 2015.†185 Hugely indebted property developer Evergrande's missed bond payments in September and
October 2021 likely also animated Party concerns about ties between nonstate companies and state-owned lenders.‡186

*A host of other factors likely contributed to the Party's concerns about Huarong and its ability to dispose of
nonperforming loans (NPLs). Huarong is one of the original four asset management companies established by the Chinese
government in 1999 to take NPLs off the balance sheets of the country's state-owned banks amid the government's broader
bailout of them at the time. Beginning in 2006, Huarong expanded into several other lines of noncore business, including
banking, brokerage, and fund management services, as well as lending to property developers, thereby departing from its
original mandate of helping state-owned banks dispose of NPLs and growing in systemic importance. Ling Huawei, "Ling
Huawei: Huarong Can't Be Treated Like a Normal Company in Bankruptcy Restructuring," Caixin, April 12, 2021.

†The CCDI previously investigated China's financial sector in 2015 in the wake of a stock market rout and as part of the
CCP's broader anticorruption campaign. In that investigation, the CCDI dispatched 15 inspection teams across 21
financial institutions (compared to 15 inspection teams across 25 financial institutions in 2021). Analysts assess the
2015 investigation was politically motivated, targeting patronage networks linked to specific political figures as Xi
moved to consolidate power. It also targeted specific forms of market malfeasance, with probes into CITIC Securities
General Manager Cheng Boming for insider trading and top officials at the then China Banking Regulatory Commission for
corruption. Reuters, "Four China Banking Regulators Demoted as Anti-Corruption Crackdown on Financial Sector Continues,"

## CCP Investigates Major Financial Institutions to Ensure Political Fealty—Continued

Particular scrutiny was applied to financial support of areas Xi no longer wants to see expand, such as in real estate
(e.g., lending to Evergrande), as well as sensitive areas wherein Xi assesses that the rapid growth and influence of
nonstate firms threatens the CCP's political control (e.g., fintech giant Ant Group and ride-sharing firm Didi
Chuxing).187 The CCP is particularly concerned that state regulators have become too close with large and influential
nonstate firms.188 In a preliminary review of their inspection work in February 2022, the CCDI warned financial
regulators to be wary of problems arising from the "revolving door" of staff moving between regulatory agencies and
commercial institutions.189 The CCDI also called for improved efforts to prevent the "barbaric expansion of capital."190
Xi's use of investigations, discipline, and punishment aims to ensure political fealty and enforce stricter adherence to
his developmental agenda.

## Ideology in the Economic Domain: Xi Conditions Thought to Induce "Correct" Decisions

Xi's efforts to increasingly guide and control the economy through the bureaucracy suffer from what Xi and his Party
propaganda organs routinely refer to as "formalism" and "bureaucratism."191 These are forms of the principal-agent
problem and refer to issues of lackadaisical implementation and the development of independent bureaucratic interests.
Xi has warned China's leading officials that "formalism and bureaucratism kill people!"192 He has further denounced
these two issues as existential threats to the Party, describing them as the most hated aspects and a core reason for
the fall of the Soviet Union.193 In contrast to Western critiques of "bureaucracy" that focused on structural issues,
the CCP has routinely treated "bureaucratism" as stemming from wrong thought, moral failings, and weak ideological
commitment.194 As made clear in an edited volume of Xi's speeches against formalism and bureaucratism that cadres were
made to study in 2020, formalism and bureaucratism result from an improper worldview and ideology as well as lack of
"faith" and weak "ideals and convictions."195 Unlike Mao, who during the Cultural Revolution incited ideological fervor
among the masses to attack Party and government structures and officials, Xi is seeking to use ideology to energize
Party and government officials to faithfully and vigorously carry out his top-level guidance and engage in a permanent
"self-revolution" to internalize his sanctioned approach to thinking, behaving, and ultimately making decisions.*196

Ideologically molding official decision-making is a crucial cornerstone of Xi's approach to furthering his economic
agenda, going well beyond simple reward and punishment and venturing into deeper

*"Self-revolution" is a common theme in Xi's speeches. In context, it refers to a process of self-evaluation and
self-criticism, geared especially toward inducing the individual to be a better cadre who pursues a disciplined life and
thoroughly imbibes the thought and policy preferences of Xi.

aspects of thought control.* The inculcation of what is termed Xi Jinping's Economic Thought has only grown more
intensive in the runup to the 20th Party Congress. In June 2022, the Central Propaganda Department† and the National
Development and Reform Commission jointly organized and published a new book, the Outline for Studying Xi Jinping's
Economic Thought, which was immediately made mandatory reading for all Party organizations at all levels.197 In
studying, cadres were told to "arm their minds with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era" so as to "guide practice, promote work, and more consciously use Xi Jinping's economic thought to guide and
solve practical problems," particularly in areas related to Xi's "new development philosophy."‡ 198 In effect, Xi wants
CCP cadres, particularly those in the most important economic decision-making positions, to internalize his top-level
economic development priorities and reflexively produce economic decisions that align with those priorities.§ Correct
thought, in Xi's view, translates into correct action, allowing "the majority of Party members and the masses to feel
the formidable power of ideals and beliefs by means of practical actions."¶ 199 David Ownby and Timothy Cheek, China
scholars with expertise in political ideology and governance, call Xi's efforts a "revival of governing by ideology" and
consider them a direct response "to the increasing social and intellectual pluralism that China's economic development
and engagement with the world have produced."200

of dynastic rise and fall through a paradigm of what he describes as the historical tragedy of great prosperity
begetting decline, wherein he sees comfort and wealth bringing on ideological laxity, corruption, moral depravity, and
lack of discipline, ultimately leading the ruling regime to fall apart. Xi Jinping, "We Must Be Consistent in Carrying

## Governing by Ideology: Zero-COVID Campaign Puts Political Ideology over Economic Growth—Continued

coronavirus (COVID-19) as a "political task."201 In spite of considerable economic costs and reports of popular
resentment in 2022, local officials have prioritized strict containment measures for fear of potential political and
disciplinary consequences from outbreaks.202 In May 2022, Bloomberg reported that more than 4,000 officials had been
punished in relation to 51 outbreaks of COVID-19 in China.203

Stringent lockdowns under Zero-COVID also showcase the policy confusion, conflicting imperatives, and political
liability facing cadres. Both the National Development and Reform Commission as well as the State Council have issued
measures pushing back on excessive closures and mobility restrictions.204 Other official guidance, including a May 2022
virtual meeting of over 100,000 officials, has also urged local governments to focus on shoring up economic growth.205
In at least one case, officials have even been punished for excessive control measures, including cadres in China's
northern Heilongjiang Province.206

## The Party Commands All: Party Penetration of Nonstate Enterprises and Market Steerage

While Xi reconsolidates the Party-state's capacity to steer the economy through systematic efforts at reward,
punishment, and indoctrination, he is also directing an expansion of the Party into all aspects of the economy,
including prominent nonstate firms. Xi's core political principle that "the Party leads everything" was explicitly
edited into the Party charter at the 19th Party Congress, at the same time Xi made very clear in his report at the 19th
Party Congress that "there must be no irresolution about working to encourage, support, and guide the development of the
non-public sector."207

The rapid expansion of Party organizations within economic entities has been a lynchpin of economic decision-making
under Xi. As of 2021, according to official statistics released by Xinhua News, the CCP had over 4.8 million Party
organizations embedded throughout society, including 1.5 million in enterprises, 933,000 in public institutions, and
742,000 in government agencies.208 Jude Blanchette, Center for Strategic and International Studies Freeman Chair in
China Studies, documents that this resurgence of Party organizations in firms began between 2015 and 2017 as foreign
companies began to notice Party organizations becoming more active in day-to-day activities of their firms, while
Chinese companies increasingly incorporated a role for the organizations into their articles of association.209

Xi hopes to attain two objectives with his increasing penetration of and control over the nonstate sector: first, to
rein in economic activity he views as contrary to CCP goals and values; and second, to enlist the nonstate sector in
advancing key policy objectives. On the former, policies and campaigns launched by Xi have aimed to limit accumulation
of resources and power in centers outside the Party. In part, this stems from a belief that underregulated nonstate
entities
---
57

will cause financial instability or otherwise undermine market integrity, for instance by building up and abusing
monopoly positions.*
Relatedly, the CCP under Xi has ramped up regulation of nonstate
companies with extensive control over consumer data or issuance of
consumer credit.† Beyond control of resources and market influence,
Xi has targeted sectors dominated by nonstate firms that do not toe
the Party line, most notably major internet and education technology companies in 2021.‡ On the latter—enlisting
nonstate firms in
fulfilling policy objectives—CCP policy pronouncements expect that
market dynamism can deliver where state-owned enterprises and
the state-dominated banking system have not, particularly on goals
related to innovation.210

Financial Levers Aim to Tilt Capital Markets toward Funding Policy
    Objectives

To achieve an economic outcome that balances these disparate
motivations, economic decisions under Xi have attempted to create a
financial system and regulatory framework that: (1) guides nonstate
capital and firms toward realizing objectives that enhance CCP authority or China's comprehensive national power while
avoiding
misallocation of resources and other inefficiencies of central planning; and (2) keeps nonstate entities on message
ideologically and
constrains their market influence and power vis-à-vis the CCP. To
these ends, economic decisions under Xi regarding the nonstate sector have focused on reinforcing carrots and sticks via
financial market development and regulatory campaigns.

Financial market development under Xi has focused on bringing corporate fundraising onshore and encouraging inflows of
foreign capital
while also enabling the CCP to influence which firms get funding.§ The
intended outcome is to finance China's technology development objectives by creating a pipeline of venture-backed firms
able to raise large
initial public offerings (IPOs) on domestic exchanges.

ments and agencies as VC investors raising both government and outside investment to fund firms in sectors designated as
priorities under Chinese industrial policies, such as semiconductor manufacturing or biotechnology.* In practice, the
outside investment is often still derived from the state-funded sources such as state-owned enterprises and state-run
banks.† 212 A study conducted by Gavekal, a research consultancy, at the height of government guidance fund raising
efforts in late 2018 found that it was typical for state sources to constitute at least 90 percent of the capital raised
by many of the funds. 213

- Public markets: Under Xi, China has launched two attempts to create new stock exchanges that cater to Chinese tech
startups. Rules for listing on the main boards of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges favor established firms with
larger revenue bases. The Shanghai Stock Exchange opened the STAR market in July 2019 and shares began trading on the
Beijing Stock Exchange in November 2021. 214 Both focus on listing technology firms; when the Beijing Stock Exchange
opened, nearly a quarter of the companies listed on the exchange made engineering, agriculture, or aviation equipment.
215 The design of capital markets could further prioritize projects favored by the Party through a "traffic light"
mechanism proposed at the Central Economic Work Conference in December 2021. 216 No formal policy has yet been released,
but a report by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and comments by finance officials suggest the
mechanism would incentivize investment in "green light" priority areas and prevent investment in "red light" areas (for
more on the traffic light system, see Chapter 2, Section 1, "Year in Review: Economics and Trade"). 217

Under Xi, China's financial regulators have also aggressively choked off financing to nonstate entities they view as
unaligned with the CCP's economic or political goals. Perhaps most notably, the Shanghai Stock Exchange suspended
Alibaba affiliate Ant Group's planned IPO in November 2020, a decision Xi reportedly issued himself after former Alibaba
CEO Jack Ma publicly criticized China's financial regulators. 218 China's government also exacerbated China's economic
slowdown in 2020 and 2021 by blocking bank lending to highly indebted property developers.

## Consequences for China's Economy

Although Xi assesses centralization and his nationalist modernization drive to be in a highly symbiotic relationship, in
practice these two trends may very well work at cross-purposes. First, the

and Profit Motive," in U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 2, Section 3, "The Chinese
Government's Evolving Control of the Nonstate Sector," in 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 224–226.

†As researchers at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology note, government guidance funds typically
use the limited partnership structure common in private equity. The guidance fund's general partner is generally a fund
manager established by a government agency or a state-owned investment firm or third-party fund manager, while other
investors, though predominantly investing state funds, are limited partners. Ngor Luong, Zachary Arnold, and Ben Murphy,

59

manner in which the CCP is pursuing its top-down drive to rein in the fragmented bureaucracy, local governments, and
vested interests may be undermining the local experimentation that has served as an important source of regime
adaptability and resilience. Lower-level officials and economic decision-makers are now simultaneously beset with an
increasingly complex set of modernization mandates from the top as well as an increasingly coercive performance
monitoring regime, creating fear and paralysis.

Second, as in other areas of CCP economic decision-making, policy toward the nonstate sector under Xi has been guided by
a "Party knows best" mentality. Further embedding of Leninist political institutions in China's nonstate firms increases
top-down control and drives companies to fill political rather than market objectives. This approach treats the market
as a tool to allocate resources toward ends predetermined by the CCP and is skeptical of any market function beyond
serving policy goals. As a result, policy rather than the market increasingly determines where resources are allocated,
while greater involvement of the nonstate sector in fulfilling policy objectives continues to lead to wasted investment
and overcapacity.*

Encouragement of nonstate capital to invest in China's speculative VC and stock markets has also increased financial
risks. Where industrial policy formerly relied on provision of bank loans to state-owned enterprises, China's current
direction ties a greater share of private wealth to the inefficiency and poor returns of the planned economy. Leninist
revival and reassertion of state intervention is, and will continue, leading nonstate firms to look to Beijing rather
than the market for resources, permission, and guidance. Rather than broadly promoting innovation-driven development and
improving productivity, factors fundamental to Beijing's aspirational rejuvenation, Xi's centralization of economic
decision-making may undermine them.

Finally, Xi's recentralization process to overcome parochial vested interests may simply be leading one set of regime
insiders to replace another. The Party-state's growing control over economic resources and capacity to steer the economy
reinforces incentives for corruption and state capture and only expands the role for vested interests, at least in the
economic arenas and industries Xi favors. At the same time, a growing coterie of Xi loyalists is nested throughout the
Party-state structure, creating the potential for insiders to operate below the surface so long as they espouse
political loyalty and limit ostentatious signs of corruption. Centralization may therefore not only work at cross
purposes with Xi's aspirational modernization goals (i.e., success even on his own terms) but also exacerbate some of
the most pressing problems he set out to resolve in the first place.

*Poor results of China's various semiconductor funds, which have channeled an estimated $150 billion in state funding
into developing the country's semiconductor industry, are a case in point. Most of the fabrication technologies acquired
in China's semiconductor push are generations behind the cutting edge, and where China has managed to close the gap,
production remains in very small scale. For more on China's semiconductor industry, see Chapter 2, Section 4, "U.S.

# Foreign Policy Decision-Making

General Secretary Xi's concentration of power in the CCP and into his own hands extends to China's foreign policy
decision-making system.219 Under Xi, China's foreign policy decision-making apparatus is increasingly centralized and
concentrated at the highest levels in order to address perceived risks to the CCP's authority emanating from China's
international environment. Institutional reforms to the foreign policy system under Xi stem from his and other CCP
leaders' perception of growing security risks in the international arena and reflect a desire for a more rapid and
efficient decision-making process, better policy coordination, and more reliable implementation in the changing
environment.220 As CCP Politburo member and top diplomat Yang Jiechi put it in 2017, China's foreign policy approach
under Xi developed in response to "profound changes in China's relations with the world" and is designed to "enable
[China] to firmly occupy a position of strategic initiative amidst a complicated and oft-changing international
structure."221

## Foreign Policy Decision-Making Prior to Xi

The CCP leadership has been the central authority for China's foreign policy since the founding of the PRC in 1949.222
Under Xi's predecessors Jiang and Hu, this foreign policy decision-making apparatus was headed by the Politburo and
Politburo Standing Committee, which met frequently to decide on foreign policy issues on behalf of the CCP Central
Committee.223 Party sources described the decision-making process as "collective leadership, democratic centralism,
individual preparation and decisions made at meetings."224 The general secretary had particular influence as the only
Politburo Standing Committee member with a specifically designated purview over foreign affairs.225 Nevertheless, he
remained only "first among equals" on all matters, while other members had the liberty to dissent and at times even
prevailed over his foreign policy preferences, such as then Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang's
endorsement supporting China National Petroleum Corporation's investment in an unstable Sudan.226

Beneath the top Party leadership, foreign policy formulation drew on a deep and complex bureaucratic hierarchy that
included the former Central Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group and Central National Security Leading Small Group, which
assisted the Party leaders in consensus building.227 It also included line ministries responsible for information
gathering and the provision of policy recommendations in addition to implementation, such as the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Ministry of Commerce, and Ministry of State Security.228 Additionally, reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping
caused a strong trend toward "diversification" of relevant actors in China's foreign policy system.229 Beginning in the
1980s, actors such as foreign affairs think tanks, local governments, and Chinese companies emerged as important players
in China's foreign policy and created a layered foreign policy with multiple stakeholders.230 Provinces and major cities
in particular took the initiative to advance their own foreign relations and develop new links abroad.231
---
61

## Centralizing Decision-Making Power in the CCP

Xi has strengthened the role of central Party leadership in the foreign policy decision-making process relative to the
ministries and other actors. As Yang Jiechi explained in 2018, the explicit end goal of this centralization is an
arrangement by which "the Party assumes full responsibility for the overall situation and coordinates the foreign
affairs work of all parties."232 As in other fields, the formalization of decision-making power in CCP commissions
reflects a strengthening of Party control relative to other actors.

As he has in other policy areas, Xi has advanced this goal by reconstituting the CCP's leading small groups as permanent
standing commissions of the Central Committee, turning them into a "true nerve center" of the Party's foreign
policymaking process.233 This change gives the CCP central leadership more power to coordinate actions by various parts
of the bureaucracy, cut through bureaucratic roadblocks, and override competing goals by other stakeholders.234 An
important example is the promotion of the Party's Central Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group to permanent status as the
Central Foreign Affairs Commission (CFAC)* in March 2018, which strengthened the CCP's ability to coordinate and manage
everyday foreign affairs work.235 Whereas the former Central Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group was reportedly often
bypassed by government agencies who viewed it as ineffective, the CFAC, and more specifically the CFAC Office,† has
become the central executive organ for foreign policy decision-making under Xi's leadership.236 The head of the CFAC
Office, currently Yang Jiechi, reports directly to Xi in the latter's role as CFAC Chairman, and Xi in turn relies upon
the CFAC Office for information on major foreign policy issues.237 In contrast, the Minister of Foreign Affairs
(currently Wang Yi), does not have a direct line to Xi and must report to the CFAC.238

Xi's elevation of the CNSC further strengthened Party leadership over the conduct of China's foreign policy by
overlaying foreign policy decisions with considerations of regime security.239 Because of the broad nature of Xi's
Comprehensive National Security Concept, there is inevitable overlap between jurisdictions of the CNSC and the CFAC when
considering national security threats from abroad.240 The CNSC is regarded as more prominent and important to foreign
affairs than even the CFAC due to the former's direct association with Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept.‡241

*The full membership of the CFAC has not been publicized, although it likely includes the members of its predecessor,
the Central Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group, namely the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CCP International
Liaison Department, Propaganda Department, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State
Security, Ministry of Commerce, the Taiwan Affairs Office, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office, the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Office, and the State Council Information Office. Jean-Pierre Cabestan, "China's Foreign and Security Policy
Institutions and Decision-Making under Xi Jinping," British Journal of Politics and International Relations 23:2 (2021):
319–336, 324.

†The CFAC Office is the permanent staff organization that supports the operations of the CFAC. It is also sometimes
referred to as the Central Committee Foreign Affairs Office (CCFAO) or the Central Office of Foreign Affairs (COFA).

Decision-Making under Xi Jinping," British Journal of Politics and International Relations 23:2 (2021): 324–325.

‡While the exact division of responsibilities between the two commissions is not explicitly defined in public
information, it is likely that the CNSC would take priority over the CFAC in the event of a conflict of interest. In
addition to the CNSC possessing a direct affiliation with Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept, the CNSC's
aggregate membership also outranks
---
62

The practical implication of this difference in ranking is that any decisions the CFAC makes on the conduct of diplomacy
must comport with national security requirements set by the CNSC.^242

In parallel with the centralization of authority in the Party, latitude for local actors to design and drive foreign
interactions has also been constrained under Xi. Although the legacy of foreign policy diversification under previous
leaders means local governments are still allowed to commit to some outbound international investment projects without
first acquiring central approval, Xi has increasingly limited local government autonomy in foreign affairs.^243 Since Xi
came to power, central government agencies involved in foreign affairs have put a stronger emphasis on ensuring uniform
policy implementation at the local level.^244 According to a written statement submitted for the Commission's hearing
record from Jean-Pierre Cabestan, research professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University, the central
government has especially strengthened its control over the external relations of regions Beijing considers sensitive,
such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia.^245

## Putting Xi at the Core of China's Foreign Policy

Xi has strengthened his personal role in foreign policy decision-making through his political elevation within the
Party, a de-emphasis on collective decision-making, and his increasing influence over the Party's official ideology.^246
Yang Jiechi summarized the new state of affairs in a July 2021 People's Daily article, stating that "Xi Jinping has made
the strategies" for China's foreign relations since coming to power and attributing diplomatic achievements firstly to
"Xi Jinping's personal commandership and actions."^247 Yun Sun, senior fellow and codirector of the East Asia program
and director of the China studies program at the Stimson Center, assessed in her testimony to the Commission that the
model of foreign policy decision-making based around collective leadership "ended with [General Secretary] Xi's
ascension to power," to be replaced by a system centered on adhering to Xi's ultimate authority.^248 Although foreign
policy decisions remain subject to a level of approval by the Politburo or its Standing Committee, Xi's elevated
political status bolsters his ability to impose his personal decisions on those bodies relative to his predecessors.^249
His position as chairman of both the CFAC and the CNSC also multiplies his authority by giving him the ability to direct
and supervise the work of both commissions and their associated offices.^250 On a purely operational level, compared to
his predecessors, Xi has made greater use of his authority to convene high-level foreign affairs work conferences,
conduct foreign diplomatic travel, and receive foreign visitors.^251

Xi enforces his paramount authority to personally guide China's foreign policy decision-making through the official
promotion of so-called "Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy." Authoritative Party sources present this supposed summary of
Xi's foreign policy positions as the foundational theory and "guide for action" for China's foreign affairs work.^252

macy also suggest his prerogative includes not only the right to give high-level guidance on broad matters like
"strategy," "doctrine," and "principles" but also the ability to give direction on lower-level "responsibilities,"
"mechanisms," "operations," and "tactics" of China's foreign affairs.253 A summary of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy
has been compiled and distributed across the Party and foreign policy apparatus, and the study of its contents has been
mandated to ensure the bureaucracy's compliance with Xi's vision.254 Demonstrating that the broader trend of Xi's
personal embodiment of Party authority also applies in foreign policy, Yang Jiechi claimed in Qiushi in 2017 that Xi
Jinping Thought on Diplomacy represents the will and conclusions of the entire Central Committee.255

## Xi's Major Foreign Policy Initiatives: Case Studies

### Belt and Road Initiative

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is widely considered Xi's "signature" foreign policy initiative, provides an
illustration of the top-down, Party-centered, and personalized foreign policymaking process in the Xi era.256 Official
descriptions* of BRI trace its development from an idea originating with Xi himself, through high-level Party
coordination, to elaboration within central government ministries, and finally to lower-level implementation by local
governments and in the international arena.257 The process exhibits a high degree of vertical coordination in which
lower-level decisions are mandated within the framework set out for them from above.258 Yuen Yuen Ang, associate
professor at the University of Michigan, describes BRI as a clear example of a "policy campaign" in which the top leader
mobilizes bureaucrats and other stakeholders to support a single vision, which may initially be relatively loosely
defined.259 Throughout the process, Xi has remained both a driving force behind BRI's privileged status and a gatekeeper
for policy adjustments. The combination of his personal leadership and a strict interpretation of China's national
security interests leave little space for meaningful policy changes.

### Top-Down, Party-Centric Mobilization

The guiding concept and overall design for BRI originated at the top of the system, and Xi announced its original
components in two international speeches in September and October 2013.†260 Since

*A speech by Xi in November 2021 clearly illustrated the top-down design of the BRI, insisting: "It is necessary to
persist in the Party's centralized and unified leadership; the Leading Small Group must grasp well the coordination and
control of major plans, major policies, major items, major issues, and annual key tasks. Relevant departments must
incorporate joint construction of the 'Belt and Road' into the important agenda and make overall plans for effective
implementation of international project construction and risk prevention and control responsibilities. Local governments
must find an orientation to participate in the joint construction of the 'Belt and Road.'" Similarly, an official
description of BRI posted by China's representative mission to the UN traces the idea directly from Xi's introduction,
to the creation of a CCP leading group, to the publication of government plans, to the eventual consultation with other
countries in international fora and BRI's incorporation into the agenda in international organizations. China Internet
News Center and China Institute of International Studies, "Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and China's Diplomacy in the
New Era: One Belt One Road" (习近平外交思想和新时代中国外交：一带一路), Translation; Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China to
the United Nations Office at Geneva and Other International Organizations in Switzerland, "The Belt and Road Initiative:
Progress, Contributions and Prospects."

†Experts assess that Xi came up with the idea along with some of his closest advisors. Xi frequently describes himself
as having proposed the initiative and in 2017 claimed "This initiative originates from my observation and reflection on
the world situation." Nadège Rolland,

BRI's inception, Xi has mobilized the Party and government appa-
ratus to carry out the initiative as a priority task and established
a government hierarchy to implement it.261 Only a month after Xi's
second speech, the CCP Central Committee endorsed the concept
as a component of China's long-term economic strategy in its Third
Plenum.262 Party leadership further elevated the initiative in 2014
at the Central Economic Work Conference, the CCP-led economic
planning meeting between the CCP Central Committee and State
Council that lays out an economic policy agenda for the coming
year.263 In March 2015, the CCP demonstrated its intention to co-
ordinate the initiative at the highest level by creating a Central
Leading Small Group for BRI Development headed by a member
of the Politburo Standing Committee and including several other
Politburo members.264 The office for the leading small group was
established within the National Development and Reform Commis-
sion, ensuring a close link between the Party decision-makers and
government bureaucracy.265 The National Development and Reform
Commission, in turn, was put in charge of coordinating actual BRI
projects with support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Min-
istry of Commerce.*266

General Secretary Xi's Personal Role

BRI is closely linked to Xi's personal legacy,† giving it staying
power in China's foreign policy system.267 Ms. Sun assessed in her
testimony that "through the Initiative, Xi successfully tied the whole
foreign policy apparatus to his personal leadership and authority
over Chinese foreign policy."268 A close affiliation with Xi makes
BRI an unavoidable topic for all relevant agencies and means that
a lack of enthusiasm in participation risks being interpreted as po-
litical disloyalty.269 Xi has also used his status to continue involving
himself in the ongoing promotion, implementation, and redefinition
of BRI. According to commentary from China's Ministry of National
Defense in 2021, BRI remains subject to "the personal planning, per-
sonal deployment, and personal promotion of General Secretary Xi
Jinping."270 Since 2013, Xi has demonstrated a continued personal
commitment to BRI by promoting it in his own speeches, leading

Politburo study sessions on the topic, presiding over international symposiums and conferences, and carrying out both
overseas visits and domestic inspections.271

BRI also conforms to Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept in its emphasis on coordinating all available national
resources to pursue both internal and external security goals under strict Party leadership. The project is designed to
mobilize and coordinate the use of political, economic, diplomatic, military, and ideological resources in an integrated
way to pursue both internal and external security objectives.272 An independent task force report published by the U.S.
Council on Foreign Relations concluded that China's leaders hope BRI will improve China's security by several means,
including by reorienting global economic activity toward China; increasing economic growth and thus political stability
in China's minority-dominated regions; generating economic leverage China can use to pressure other countries not to
criticize its government and policies; and providing intelligence and access to facilities that could one day benefit
China's military.273 As in other policy fields, Xi's guidance on BRI also emphasizes the necessity of Party leadership
and control as well as the proactive management of risks.274

## Top-Level Adjustment to an Unchanged Agenda

Although BRI has undergone some reframing in response to changing international conditions, the policy adjustments have
largely been issued from the top and have not altered the policy's underlying objective. Poor financial, social, and
environmental standards of BRI projects produced widespread international pushback after the first few years of
mobilization, and China has responded to global criticism by attempting to rebrand BRI and improve its international
reputation.275 Xi has personally led this effort from the top, pledging in 2018 to reorient the initiative toward
poverty alleviation, green development, economic sustainability, and higher project standards.276 Official sources
credit Xi with "put[ting] forward a new requirement for the next stage of work," namely the new focus on "high-quality
development."277 A comparison of Xi's speeches before and after this adjustment also reflect a shift in messaging toward
a greater emphasis on consultation, environmental impact, standards, and project quality.278 Nevertheless, this
messaging shift and any accompanying adjustments to project type alter neither the overall security benefits the Chinese
leadership seeks from the initiative nor its fundamental implementation process or its privileged place in China's
diplomatic interactions.279

## Global Security Initiative

Xi's Global Security Initiative is another example of how major diplomatic projects are conceived, introduced, and
expanded within his centralized foreign policy system. The Global Security Initiative is Xi's recently announced effort
to reshape the norms of international security and make them more favorable to China, primarily by delegitimizing
military alliances as a means of achieving security goals.280 (For more on the objectives of the Global Security
Initiative, see Chapter 3, Section 1, "Year in Review: Security and Foreign Affairs.") The initiative has been described
internally as a "concrete
---
66

manifestation of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy," linking it to Xi's broader vision and instructions for the conduct of
China's foreign affairs.281 As a relatively recent initiative, it provides a window into the process of continuous
policy development under Xi whereby new initiatives are built upon the foundation of his previously established
concepts.

Like BRI, the Global Security Initiative is a framework Xi introduced to guide China's foreign policy that is being
carried out and elaborated upon through top-down Party leadership. It was introduced as a relatively broad concept by Xi
himself at the Boao Forum for Asia* on April 21, 2022.282 Xi's speech laid out six major elements of the initiative,
which have since been officially designated the "six commitments."†283 In the months since the Global Security
Initiative's introduction, the "six commitments" have been faithfully echoed in other Party and government sources and
gradually rolled out in diplomatic statements around the globe.284 Although the Global Security Initiative is still in
its earliest stages, Dr. Greitens assessed in her testimony that it is likely to closely follow the pattern set by Xi's
other named initiatives over the upcoming one to two years as the various levels of the Party-state work to transform
Xi's initial directive into concrete policies.285

Policy concepts and Party structures Xi has put in place already appear to have played a leading role in the development
of the new initiative. As Dr. Greitens explained in her testimony for the Commission, the Global Security Initiative
should be understood as the international projection of Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept that centers on
regime security.286 Although the initiative has not yet been widely presented as such abroad, authoritative Chinese
sources are very explicit about this framing and argue that Xi's national security concept forms the "theoretical
foundation" for the Global Security Initiative.287 For example, the Global Security Initiative is referred to as "a
vivid practice for guiding China's diplomatic work based on the Comprehensive National Security Concept" and a "further
enrich[ment of] the 'world chapter' of the Comprehensive National Security Concept."288 Based on an assessment of its
publications in 2022, a particular Party-affiliated research organization known as the Comprehensive National Security
Concept Research Center also appears to have played a leading role in both laying the theoretical groundwork for and
fleshing out the initial details of the Global Security Initiative.289 The organization was founded on April 14, 2021,
with the mandate to develop and promote

†The "six commitments" are: (1) "staying committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable
security"; (2) "staying committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries"; (3)
"staying committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter"; (4) "staying committed to taking
seriously the legitimate security concerns of all countries"; (5) "staying committed to peacefully resolving differences
and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation"; and (6) "staying committed to maintaining security in
both traditional and non-traditional domains." China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Global Security Initiative—China's

Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept.*290 This tight association with Xi's guiding principle on China's national
security will likely ensure the Global Security Initiative remains a foreign policy priority as long as Xi is in power.

## Consequences for Foreign Affairs

Xi lays out an assertive direction for China's foreign policy, which is then faithfully carried out by the institutional
setup beneath him.291 Xi's vision for China's foreign affairs is one that manages China's external environment to ensure
China's "rejuvenation" under the CCP is accommodated and facilitated abroad.292 The CNSC's domination of the
bureaucratic level ensures that policy choices conform to a strict interpretation of China's national security
interests, leaving little space for ambiguity or compromise.293 The mandate from above in turn compels the diplomatic
corps to adopt the "Wolf Warrior" ethos, treating any perceived slight against China internationally as an attack
warranting an aggressive response.294

On a conceptual level, Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept acts as an important framework for foreign policy
decision-making under Xi.295 In other words, the mandate of China's diplomatic corps is determined through a lens of
regime security and includes defending Beijing's broad definition of territorial sovereignty, combatting what it
considers separatism and terrorism, defending overseas interests, promoting economic and financial security, and—above
all—maintaining the leadership of the CCP and the socialist system.296 For example, China's March 2021 retaliatory
countersanctions against entities and individuals in the EU were applied not only to official government institutions
and representatives but also to two independent think tanks and two private scholars because the CCP alleged that their
critical analysis of China's repressive Hong Kong and Xinjiang policies was a threat to China's "national sovereignty,
national security and development interests."297 In a summary article on Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy in May 2022,
Yang Jiechi further illustrated this concept by highlighting China's "forceful" responses to other countries' so-called
"provocations" related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, maritime issues, and human rights as a key success for China's
diplomacy over the past year.298

Xi's political elevation produces a reinforcing "bandwagon effect" throughout the bureaucracy and in research
institutions, decreasing the channels for contrasting ideas to influence choices at the top.299 According to Yun Sun,
Xi's leading role means officials who do not share his vision for foreign policy "are naturally

*The secretariat of the Comprehensive National Security Concept Research Center is located inside the China Institutes
of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR)—itself a leading policy research organ under the supervision of the CCP
Central Committee. According to CICIR's president, Yuan Peng, the Research Center's work is currently oriented around
the "study, research, and promot[ion]" of an official outline of Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept, which was
produced by the CCP Central Committee's Propaganda Department and the Office of the Central National Security
Commission, which Xi chairs. Yuan Peng, "The Fundamental Principles for Maintaining and Shaping National Security in the

marginalized in the decision-making circle." 300 Xi has also over-
seen the imposition of stricter political controls on policy think
tanks. 301 At the lower levels, scholars whose views contrast with
the top leadership's position do not receive support for their
work, as resources are directed toward those who will defend Xi's
chosen agenda. 302 Thus, even though there has been an increase
in the number of think tanks during Xi's tenure, there is little
reason to believe they will publicly question the assertive course
set at the top of the system. 303

BRI's evolution as a foreign policy platform illustrates that Xi can
command rigorous implementation of his foreign policy initiatives
through all levels of China's foreign affairs bureaucracy as well as
at the local levels and that his framing has staying power in China's
system even in the face of international backlash. Although Chi-
na's foreign policy apparatus is also capable of making adjustments,
such changes must still be centrally directed and may even be large-
ly cosmetic in nature, reflecting a change in the top's assessment of
the best way to reach a consistent goal rather than a fundamental
policy reorientation. The Global Security Initiative further illumi-
nates the lasting effect of Xi's initiatives by illustrating how new
policies can continue to grow out of the foundational ideas and in-
stitutions Xi created.

## Military Decision-Making

China's decision-making on the use of its military and paramili-
tary forces is highly centralized and increasingly personalized. Com-
mand authority for China's military and paramilitary forces rests
with the CMC, the CCP Central Committee's designated military
policy body.* Under General Secretary Xi, reforms increased cen-
tralization and vested more responsibility and final decision-mak-
ing power in Xi himself. Consequently, the goals and use of China's
military and paramilitary forces are subject to immense personal
discretion by Xi, particularly in crisis situations. CCP leaders con-
tinuously scrutinize the military's loyalty, with several reforms and
increased emphasis on "political work" in the military and paramili-
tary forces designed to strengthen loyalty to the Party and ultimate-
ly to Xi himself. This combination of central control and emphasis
on political loyalty leads to micromanagement and inefficiency in
some areas of military decision-making.

The CCP's decision-making for the military must account for the
paradox of coercive power: that the very organizations with the ca-
pability to physically defend the Party and the regime from internal
and external threats definitionally also possess a latent ability to
threaten the regime itself. In recognition of this paradox, the CCP
has granted armed forces two primary missions: to "obey the Par-
ty's command" and be able to "fight and win"—and notably in that
order. 304 In 2015, Xi described his greatest concerns for the Chinese

military, saying, "What I think about most is, when the Party and
the people most need it, will our military be able to always adhere
to the absolute leadership of the Party, will it be able to take on
the challenge to fight and win."305 Reforms of the decision-making
structure under Xi have sought to improve the armed forces' ability
to fulfil both missions.306

## Military Decision-Making Prior to Xi

Previous leaders' inability to assert operational authority over the
military amid a fragmented decision-making system or to address
corruption raised concerns among the top leadership about the erosion of CCP control over the military.307 The PLA
itself exercised a
significant amount of autonomy from Party leaders.308 The PLA's
four general departments* essentially operated as "independent
kingdoms" with the broad authority to make decisions in their areas
of responsibility without oversight from the CMC.309 Decision-making was impeded by a lack of information sharing, as
the PLA leveraged tight control over military intelligence and information about
its own capabilities and operations as a bureaucratic advantage
against both Party leadership and state ministries.310 The amassed
power of the poorly supervised general departments and military regions also led to growing financial waste and
corruption throughout
the force, raising serious concerns about PLA combat readiness.311
Operational decision-making was also disjointed, with command
and control split between military regions and service branches.312
Reforms necessary for modern warfare in command and control, administration, and other areas long eluded previous
leaders like Jiang and Hu due to their relatively weak position with the military
and stiff resistance from the general departments that were both
the strongest entrenched interests and the biggest prospective losers in such reforms.313

Prior to Xi's recentralization of full Party control over the military, China's governmental and local authorities
exercised a notable amount of authority and discretion regarding the use of
the military and paramilitary forces. The State Council shared
authority with the CMC over the funding and operation of the
People's Armed Police (PAP, China's paramilitary force), which
then fell under the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and subdivisions of authority tied to the provinces.314 Local
government
and Party officials had some discretionary control over local PAP
units.315 Reports from the Hu era reveal that some local leaders had coopted the PAP to carry out extralegal tax
collection,
debt recovery, land seizure, and even political violence, causing
concern that local leaders might also be able to use them to resist central authority.316 Local Party secretaries could
also take
advantage of their leadership of local Party committees to direct
operations by local PLA reserve units for personal gain.317

# Centralizing Decision-Making Power in the CCP's CMC

Reconcentration of authority over the policies and operations of all China's armed security forces, both military and
paramilitary, is a defining feature of Xi-era decision-making reforms. The CMC's role as the central institution
responsible for making decisions about the use of China's armed forces has been greatly strengthened. This level of
central control has come at the expense of previously autonomous PLA organizations, the State Council, and local
officials of both the Party and the state.

## Broadening the CMC's Central Control

Xi's military reforms overhauled the broad division of labor within the PLA such that the CMC provides overall
management and direction, the theater commands focus on operations and warfighting, and the services are responsible for
"force-building," or what the U.S. military refers to as "man, train, and equip" responsibilities.* 318 A critical
element of this effort involved disbanding the PLA's four powerful general departments into 15 less individually
powerful organizations in 2016 and incorporating their responsibilities directly into a restructured CMC.† 319 The
change reduced the accumulated power of the PLA's "General Headquarters" (the four general departments, but primarily
the General Staff Department) by placing its former functions such as training, mobilization, and strategic planning
under direct CMC control with an eye toward improving information flows between the PLA and Party leadership.320 Xi's
reforms also removed the heads of the individual services (PLA Army, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force) from direct
involvement in decision-making at the CMC level and assigned responsibility for directing warfighting to the newly
formed theater commands, taking away two key functions from the service chiefs.321

Reforms to China's paramilitary forces, namely the PAP and Coast Guard, in 2017 and 2018 made them solely responsible to
the CMC and clarified their identity as part of the broader armed forces.‡ Prior to Xi's reforms, the PAP operated under
the dual leadership of both the CMC and the State Council.322 The State Council oversaw the PAP's operations, budget,
size, and composition.323 On January 1, 2018, the CCP Central Committee discarded this dual-leadership system and
granted the CMC full control

ongoing PLA reforms in 2016. They include the General Office, Joint Staff Department, Political Work Department,
Logistics Support Department, Equipment Development Department, Training Management Department, National Defense
Mobilization Department, Discipline Inspection Commission, Political and Legal Affairs Commission, Science and
Technology Commission, Strategic Planning Office, Reform and Organization Office, International Military Cooperation
Office, Audit Bureau, and Organ Affairs General Management Bureau. Joel Wuthnow and Phillip C. Saunders, "Introduction:

of the PAP.324 In March 2018 the CCP Central Committee also divested the PAP of several law enforcement, economic, and
other non-paramilitary units (such as firefighters) and reassigned them to the State Council.* 325 That same year, the
China Coast Guard, which previously reported to the State Council's State Oceanic Administration, became the Maritime
Police Contingent of the PAP.326 The result was a unified paramilitary organization with both land and sea missions
incorporated directly into the line of military command.

## Removing Local CCP Officials from the Chain of Command

Xi's reforms removed local CCP officials from the command structure of PLA reserve and PAP units. Prior to 2016,
regional Party secretaries had frequently served as so-called "first commissars" of PLA reserve units within Provincial
Military Districts, a designation that had allowed them to act as the first among equals over a reserve unit's military
commander and political commissar.327 Roderick Lee, research director at the U.S. Air Force China Aerospace Studies
Institute, assessed in his testimony to the Commission that this role granted local civilian leaders influence over the
operations of local units and hence a level of power they could easily use for personal gain.328 After the reforms,
local civilian authorities could no longer use PLA reserve units for local purposes without the relevant theater command
assuming joint command over those forces.329 Similarly, prior to Xi's reforms, local Ministry of Public Security (MPS)
officials held the designation of "first commissar" in local PAP detachments, affording them some discretionary control
of those forces.330 As Joel Wuthnow, senior research fellow at the National Defense University Center for the Study of
Chinese Military Affairs, testified before the Commission, in practice, local government and Party leaders occasionally
summoned PAP units to stifle protests.331 Following the changes in 2017 and 2018, local officials must request authority
from the center in order to deploy the PAP.332

## Putting Xi at the Core of Armed Forces Decision-Making

Decision-making over China's security forces is increasingly centered around Xi himself. His rise in power strengthened
Party control over the armed forces, ensuring the implementation of military reforms that not only helped improve the
PLA's operational capability but also further consolidated his political power in China.333 As a 2015 commentary in the
PLA newspaper insisted, China's armed forces are responsible for "resolutely responding to the call sent out by Chairman
Xi, resolutely executing the requirements put forth by Chairman Xi, and resolutely completing the tasks bestowed upon
them by Chairman Xi."334

*The Border Defense Force and Guards Force were both absorbed by the MPS. The Firefighting Force and the Forestry Force
(responsible for fighting forest fires) were transferred to the State Council Emergency Management Department. The Gold
Force (responsible for securing gold and other resources) and the Hydropower Force (responsible for managing
hydroelectric dams) were designated as "non-active-duty professional teams" and reconstituted as state-owned enterprises
under the supervision of the State Council. Joel Wuthnow, "China's Other Army: The People's Armed Police in an Era of

## Emphasizing the Role of the CMC Chairman

The position of CMC chairman is the main source of Xi's authority over China's armed forces. Because the CMC chairman is
the only individual to sit on both the Politburo Standing Committee and the CMC, the position gives Xi sole
responsibility for coordination between the two most powerful bodies in the Party.335 Xi has also worked to strengthen
the position's authority by placing a renewed emphasis on the "Chairman Responsibility System," a stipulation in the
1982 PRC Constitution that grants ultimate authority for military affairs to the CMC chairman.336 Under Xi's
predecessors Jiang and Hu, the CMC's two uniformed vice chairmen took responsibility for the majority of CMC
decision-making on the chairman's behalf in a pattern that became known as the "Vice Chairman Responsibility System."337
Xi identified this arrangement as a major contributor to a trend of excessive PLA autonomy and has done away with it in
favor of concentrating power in his own hands.338

A 2017 amendment to the PRC Constitution and a 2020 military regulation on political work cemented this status by giving
Xi final say in all CMC work and the ability to set the military's agenda on all political and operational issues.*339
According to Mr. Lee's assessment in his testimony for the Commission, the anecdotal evidence available by cataloguing
Xi's military meeting agenda since becoming CMC chairman in 2012 suggests he is particularly involved in decision-making
on defining PLA reform milestones and objectives, transforming the Southern Theater Command into a modern joint
operations command organization, and modernizing the PLA Army and Navy.340

## Personal Ideological Promotion

Xi has also elevated his position by using official speeches, publications, and Party media to paint himself as a great
military strategist to whom the armed forces owe complete personal loyalty. Shortly after Xi came to power, a series of
high-ranking senior PLA officers made public declarations of loyalty to him, with their statements receiving an unusual
level of coverage in Party media.341 Beginning in 2016, official sources began using the title "Commander in Chief" in a
push to paint Xi as a leader who understands and commands respect from the military, on some occasions even showing him
wearing a military uniform while sitting upon a throne-like commander's chair.342 Xi has promulgated a military
component of his personal ideology, so-called "Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military," and his treatises are required
reading for soldiers.343 State media encourage the armed forces to not only study and implement

*In 2017, the PRC Constitution was amended to stipulate that the CMC chairman "assumes overall responsibility over the
work of the [CMC]," indicating that Xi's voice almost certainly has the final say among the seven members of the CMC.
Regulations on Party building in the armed forces promulgated in 2020 further stipulate that the CMC chairman must lead
and command the national armed forces and determine all major issues of national defense and military building. This
description reveals that the role of CMC chairman officially includes both political leadership and command authority
over the armed forces. Xinhua, "Comprehensively Strengthen the Party Building of the Army in the New Era: Leaders of the
Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission Answer Reporters' Questions on the Regulations on Party

2020. Translation; Xinhua, "Xi's Thoughts and 'Absolute' Party Leadership of PLA Written into the Constitution," October

Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military but also appreciate it as a
"scientific" theory of military affairs.344 State media reinforces the
message that the armed forces owe loyalty to Xi personally, repeat-
edly insisting that they must "listen to Chairman Xi's command, be
responsible to Chairman Xi, and reassure Chairman Xi."345 In a
speech in January 2017, Xi called upon the PLA to "safeguard the
core and follow commands," a phrase that was incorporated into a
formal CMC opinion two months later and made the subject of a
campaign to increase loyalty to Xi's military leadership ahead of the
19th Party Congress that fall.346

## Decreasing the Involvement of Other Party Leaders

In addition to elevating himself, Xi has gradually decreased the
involvement of other civilian leaders in military affairs.347 The del-
egation on Hu Jintao's personal inspection tours* of military orga-
nizations included senior civilian CCP members and at least one
Politburo member.348 Until 2015, Xi's inspection delegations also
included several civilian CCP leaders, such as Politburo members
Wang Huning and Li Zhanshu.349 Since 2015, however, Xi has
ceased to include any other Party leaders, and his delegation has
consisted entirely of military officers.350 According to Mr. Lee's tes-
timony before the Commission, the presence of other CCP leaders
in the inspection delegations prior to 2015 suggests they previously
had some hands-on involvement in military affairs, and their re-
moval was most likely intended to signal to the rest of the Party
leadership that Xi is now the only civilian who can be involved in
military decision-making.†351

## Enforcing Control over the Military

Decision-making on the use of China's armed forces, both military
and paramilitary, is designed to ensure the security of the CCP re-
gime. Xi's experience in Party affairs positions within the PLA and
familiarity with the CMC likely gave him insight into the areas
where Party control over the PLA had been lacking under previous
leadership.‡ The CCP under Xi has consistently and explicitly stat-

*The CCP top leader frequently conducts inspection visits to military organizations. These vis-
its allow the top leader to strengthen his reputation as a military leader by visibly demonstrating
interest in PLA affairs and underscore his attention to developments within his military area of
responsibility. In addition to this performative function, inspection tours may also help the top
leader better understand the situation on the ground. Mark Stokes, Executive Director, Project

ed that concentration of authority over the security forces under the CMC and CMC chairman is necessary to ensure the
Party remains in control and the security forces remain loyal to it rather than the state or the nation at large.

## Political Work in China's Military: The Party Must Command the Gun

Loss of Party control over the armed forces is one of several factors Xi has explicitly identified as having contributed
to the fall of the CPSU and the Soviet Union, making it a matter of critical importance under his leadership.352 The
November 2021 historical resolution reveals Xi's motivating concern for Party control over the armed forces:

> For a period of time, the Party's leadership over the military was obviously lacking. If this problem had not been
completely solved, it would not only have diminished the military's combat capacity, but also undermined the key
political principle that the Party commands the gun.353

Increased emphasis on political work in the military and paramilitary under Xi's leadership has thus focused on ensuring
that the armed forces' loyalty is to the Party and the Party alone.354 In emphasizing the danger of the Party losing its
leadership role and control over the PLA, Xi has in part sought to combat discourse on the idea of "nationalization" of
the PLA as a national army of the PRC rather than a Party army.355 Under Xi's predecessors, nationalization of the PLA
had become a topic of discussion in some PLA circles, which Xi has openly sought to rectify.356

China's military leadership does not perceive a tradeoff between the political reliability and operational capability of
its officers.357 Instead of officers being designated either "red" or "expert," according to Mr. Lee's testimony before
the Commission, "operational proficiency and political awareness are increasingly intermingled the more senior one
becomes," the ideal being to embody what CCP propaganda terms a "double expert."358 According to testimony by James
Mulvenon, former director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis at SOS International, personnel choices
in the PLA are increasingly "political choices between professional officers."359 In other words, he argues, political
criteria are employed to choose among two or more fully qualified professional officers.360 As the military capability
and professionalism of the entire PLA have risen, the system has not resulted in widespread promotion of politically
reliable people at the expense of professional military competence, as is sometimes supposed.361

## Personnel Decisions

According to the PRC's Active Military Officer Service Law, the CMC chairman officially appoints and removes all
active-duty offi-

of Party affairs positions in the PLA, including as political commissar and Party committee secretary of a reserve unit,
in a military garrison, in a military subdistrict at the municipal level, and at the provincial military district level.
Finally, in a rare appointment of a civilian senior Party cadre to the powerful position of CMC vice chairman, Xi served
for two years on the CMC prior to his appointment to general secretary of the Party and CMC chairman in 2012. People's
Daily, "Resume of Comrade Xi Jinping" (习近平同志简历), March 2018. Translation.

cers at the division grade (typically senior colonels and major gener-
als) and above.362 This authority means that as CMC chairman, Xi
has the sole authority to approve or disapprove all general and flag
officer promotions in the People's Armed Forces, a category Mr. Lee
estimates has almost certainly numbered in the thousands since
Xi became CMC chairman.363 In his testimony, Mr. Lee noted that
while it is unlikely Xi has involved himself in all of these promo-
tions,* it is relatively safe to assume that since taking office he has
had a direct say in the promotion of at least all new full generals
and admirals in the PLA.364

## Anticorruption Campaigns

Xi has used his anticorruption campaign both as a tool to at-
tempt to address the corruption issue and as an implied threat to
encourage compliance with his military reform agenda and personal
control.365 According to a compilation by the Center on U.S.-Chi-
na Relations at the Asia Society, at least 62 PLA officers had been
removed for corruption by 2018, with 46 of those officers possess-
ing a rank of major general or above.366 The continuous threat of
investigation is a potent tool to intimidate or remove officers who
might otherwise obstruct reform efforts or show insufficient loyalty
to Xi.367 In his testimony before the Commission, Dr. Mulvenon sim-
ilarly argued that the ever-present threat of replacement via the an-
ticorruption campaign "prevents the development of resistance and
factionalism within the PLA."368 In particular, he assessed that the
coercive threat of the anticorruption campaign was instrumental in
allowing Xi to achieve such a dramatic reorganization of the PLA,
which necessarily generated a lot of opposition from the losers of
the reform.369

Xi demonstrated the centrality of anticorruption to his vision of
military discipline by raising the bureaucratic status of the investiga-
tion authority. In January 2016, the PLA Discipline Inspection Com-
mission, which had been housed in the General Political Department
since 1990, was returned to the CMC, giving the inspection organi-
zation greater independence from the PLA bureaucracy.370 After this
adjustment, CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang reportedly encouraged
discipline inspectors to "take advantage of their new standing" within
the PLA when investigating PLA officers' political loyalty, power, and
responsibility.371 In October 2017, the head of the newly relocated PLA
Discipline Inspection Commission was elevated to the rank of a CMC
member, further increasing the investigation organization's authority
and acknowledging its heightened political significance.372

## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making

Xi has led a dramatic reorganization of the upper echelons of
PLA decision-making, but below the CMC, the basic mechanisms
for Party control of the military—political officers, and Party
committees—have not changed significantly. Instead of reforming
lower Party structures, Xi is reinvigorating political work within

*Mr. Lee assesses that Xi likely delegates some responsibility for such promotional decisions to
the director of the CMC Political Work Department, Miao Hua. Roderick Lee, written testimony

## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making—Continued

these structures and pressing political officers to focus on learning military affairs to participate more in military
decision-making and make political work more relevant to success in war.

### Dual Command and the Political Officer:
Throughout the PLA, from company to theater command, the PLA continues its longstanding practice known as the "military
and political dual-leadership system." 374 Under this system, every unit has two principal officers, a commander and a
political officer, who serve as co-equals and share joint responsibility for issuing orders and overseeing daily
tasks.375 The roles are designed to be complementary, with the commander responsible for military decisions and the
political officer responsible for political and personnel decisions.376 The political officer's functions combine
activities similar to a chaplain, sergeant major, inspector general, judge advocate, human resources officer, social
worker, and Party whip. His areas of responsibility range from ideological discipline to political and moral education,
military law, soldier wellbeing, and professional development.377

### Party Committees:
Like the rest of society under CCP rule, the PLA also has Party organizations embedded in each military unit and major
staff organization.* 378 "This Party committee structure creates a 'trusted agent' in the aggregate," explains Mr. Lee.
379 "Instead of having a single individual whom Xi trusts, a collective group of individuals who are promoted based on
both political and military affairs traits are responsible for unit control and oversight." 380 The political officer
and unit commander usually serve as the secretary and deputy secretary of their unit's Party committee.381

### Steady State vs. Wartime Decision-Making:
In steady state, commanders direct day-to-day military activities while political officers ensure these operations are
conducted in line with political goals.382 In transition to crisis or wartime, Mr. Lee explains, "most of a Party
committee's functions are relatively 'high-level' in nature and do not involve the Party committee needing to approve
every action made within a unit." 383 They do, however, have the authority to review in committee any decision an
individual leader, such as the commander or political officer, makes on the spot.384

### A House Divided?
A common PLA slogan, "division of labor [does] not divide the house," reminds commanders and political officers they
have different duties but must work together.385 In 2019, the PLA Daily reminded soldiers of the Gutian All-Military
Political Work Conference that CMC Chairman Xi personal-

*The term "Party committee" (党委) is used for organizations that are established at the regiment level and above. At the
battalion level and in second-level functional and administrative departments of the PLA, the relevant Party organ is
called a "grassroots Party committee" (基层党委). At the company level, they are referred to as "Party branches" (党支部). The
term "Party small group" (党小组) is used at the platoon level and for ad hoc organizations at any level that are created
for a specific purpose and have three or more Party members. Kenneth W. Allen et al., "Personnel of the People's
Liberation Army," BluePath Labs (prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), November 2022,

## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making—Continued

ly hosted five years earlier where he raised concerns that some political officers had become useless because they were
afraid to speak their voice or insert their hand in military affairs.386 Xi exhorted political officers to get more
involved in operations, training, and military command and control so that they could learn to make political work a
greater part of military success in wartime. In late 2021, the Ministry of National Defense again raised Xi's
exhortations at the Gutian conference, recommending "Meritorious Li Yannian," a new television series about a Korean War
political commissar who was an expert in both military and political affairs.387 Despite these continuing efforts,
tensions remain that raise questions about the degree to which this political oversight will complicate or slow the
PLA's military decision-making. As Mr. Lee cited in testimony to the Commission, a "PLA Navy officer who attended the
Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2016" expressed clear frustration with political oversight on military affairs when he
"lamented that the PLA's 'nanny command style' was inadequate for modern operations."388

## Control over China's Internal Security and the Political-Legal Apparatus

Similar to his efforts to assert dominance over the PLA, Xi has made it a priority since the earliest days of his
leadership to control China's domestic public security apparatus.389 In addition to the reforms to China's paramilitary
forces detailed above, Xi has dedicated significant attention to reforming elements and overall control of China's
political-legal system.390 The political-legal system is the bureaucracy responsible for law enforcement, public
security, and domestic coercion in China, including the courts, procuratorates, MPS, Ministry of State Security,*
Ministry of Justice, and police academies.†391 Changes to the political-legal system under Xi have sought to ensure the
strict, hierarchical Party control and political loyalty of the apparatus most directly linked to domestic regime
security.392

### Motivation for Enhanced Control over Political-Legal Work

Xi perceives the domestic security apparatus as a foundational guarantor of the Party's control that must remain loyal
in all circumstances.393 His focus on this area most likely reflects an under-

*The MPS is responsible for domestic law enforcement in China, including riot control and the overall maintenance of
"social order." The Ministry of State Security is China's main civilian intelligence and counterintelligence agency
whose missions include protecting China's national security writ large, securing political and social stability,
conducting counterintelligence, and implementing security-related laws. Timothy Heath, written testimony for U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on What Keeps Xi Up at Night: Beijing's Internal and External
Challenges, February 7, 2019, 8–9.

†The Chinese Communist Party Regulations on the Political Legal Work issued in January 2019 define "political-legal
units" as "specialized forces engaged in political-legal work under the leadership of the Party, primarily including
judicial organs, procuratorial organs, public security organs, national security organs, judicial administrative organs,
and other units." Xinhua, "CCP Central Committee Publishes "Chinese Communist Party Regulations on Political-Legal Work"
(中共中央印发《中国共产党政法工作条例》), January 18, 2019. Translation.

78

standing of the political-legal system as a necessary tool and weap-
on of the Party and top Party leadership.394 CCP sources commonly
refer to the public security apparatus as "the knife," and Xi has
identified that a foundational principle of political-legal work must
be "ensur[ing] that the handle of the knife is firmly grasped in the
hand of the Party and the people."395 Regulations on political-legal
work issued under Xi's tenure also make clear that political-legal
work is an important channel for the Party's leadership of so-called
"dictatorial functions,"* in other words, the coercive aspects of do-
mestic governance.396 This domestic monitoring and enforcement
capability, while theoretically targeted at enemies of the Party-state,
can nonetheless be turned even upon the CCP leadership itself.397
Without firm control over this lever of power, Xi would be unable
to secure his desired leadership for the Party or for himself in any
other policy area.

Nevertheless, upon his rise to power Xi perceived that the han-
dle of the knife had slipped dangerously out of the control of the
CCP top leadership.398 Under Hu Jintao, the public security appa-
ratus had enjoyed a significant level of autonomy and policy influ-
ence vis-à-vis the CCP top leadership in a manner similar to the
military.399 Then Politburo Standing Committee member and head
of the Party's Central Political-Legal Affairs Commission (CPLAC)
Zhou Yongkang, for example, possessed a firm grip over the regime's
intelligence and security bureaucracy and became a cautionary tale
of the dangers of such independent power.400 Zhou was suspected
of not only corruption but also conspiring with Bo Xilai against the
central Party leadership and attempting to contravene a Politbu-
ro Standing Committee consensus to purge the disgraced leader.401
Corruption and clientelism were also areas of concern.402 According
to analysis by Christopher Johnson, senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, published in conjunction with
the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, Xi perceived that
lax leadership by his predecessor had allowed the domestic security
apparatus so much leeway as to pose a threat to the cohesion of the
Party system itself.† 403

*In his work entitled "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Mao Zedong defined the "peo-
ple's democratic dictatorship" as the exercise of "democracy within the people" and "dictatorship
over the reactionaries." He explains that "the people" who support China's socialist revolution
should enjoy political freedoms, whereas the enemies of the revolution should be constrained
and oppressed. He argues that this principle is essential for the success of China's socialist rev-
olution, the welfare of the people, and the survival of the country. The concept of the "people's
democratic dictatorship" is still endorsed by the Chinese government and the CCP today. It is
included in Article 1 of the PRC Constitution as one of the core characteristics of the Chinese
socialist state. It is also mentioned three times in the opening section of the CCP charter. Xinhua,

ideals and beliefs and their values are seriously distorted, breaking the bottom lines of Party
discipline and state laws....We must carry out the Party's political discipline and organizational
discipline education in depth, never allow anything to override to the organization, never allow
any compromises or choices in implementing the Party Central Committee's decisions and de-
ployments, never allow the relationship between superiors and subordinates to become personal
relationships of dependency, and never allow the formation of cliques....At present, the anti-cor-

# Rewriting the Rules of Political-Legal Work under Xi

The CCP under Xi's leadership has made many organizational and personnel changes to the Party's leadership of
political-legal work. The overall goal of these efforts appears to have been centralizing Party control while
simultaneously preventing the reemergence of any position powerful enough to challenge the top leadership. Lines of
effort have included a realignment of the Party's existing CPLAC and its associated hierarchy;* the subordination of
political-legal work to Xi's newly defined national security goals and institutions; an ongoing series of campaigns to
ensure loyalty from the system's leaders and personnel; and relentless promotion of Xi's leading role in
political-security work.

## Reorientation and Subordination of the CPLAC

In contrast to elevating the bureaucratic status of other key Party commissions, Xi lowered the bureaucratic status of
the CPLAC even while expanding its areas of authority to centralize Party control. This anomaly was likely intended to
prevent any leader of the domestic security apparatus from developing a unique power base. Following Zhou Yongkang's
expulsion from the Party, his former portfolio as head of the CPLAC was immediately downgraded from the Politburo
Standing Committee level, where it had been since the early 2000s, to the Politburo level.404 The demotion would
severely limit the ability of any future commission head to contravene the decisions of the top CCP leadership the way
Zhou had attempted. The CCP also began to phase out the dual-hatting of local-level political-legal committee heads as
the heads of local public security bureaus.405 This reversed a practice that had become common since the late 1990s and
2000s and that had allowed the local political-legal organs to play an extremely active role in local domestic security
affairs.406 With these changes in place, the CPLAC's areas of responsibility could be safely expanded as part of the
broad Party-state reorganization effort. In March 2018, the CCP consolidated responsibility for additional channels of
political-legal work within the CPLAC by directing it to absorb the majority of the functions of three other Party
leading small groups and commissions.407 These were the Central Commission on Comprehensive Management of Societal
Security, the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work, and the Central Leading Small Group for the
Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues.†408

of the Zhou Yongkang case, but also thoroughly eliminate the impact of the Zhou Yongkang case." Meng Jianzhu,

*The CPLAC sits atop a hierarchy of lower-level political-legal committees that manage political-legal work at the
provincial and local levels. Minxin Pei, "The CCP's Domestic Security Taskmaster: The Central Political and Legal
Affairs Commission," China Leadership Monitor (September 1, 2021): 3–12.

†The CPLAC absorbed all of the functions of the first two organizations, the Central Commission on Comprehensive
Management of Societal Security and the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work. In the case of the
third organization, the Central Leading Small Group for the Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues, the CPLAC took on
the disbanded group's decision-making responsibilities while the MPS absorbed some of its administrative and
implementation functions. The reorganization plan assigned responsibility for information gathering, analysis, and
policy implementation to the MPS as a government ministry, whereas the CPLAC as a Party organization was tasked with
policy coordination and making policy recommendations
---
80

Like other parts of the bureaucracy under Xi, the CPLAC and its associated hierarchy also appear to have been subject to
the overall authority of the CNSC and its hierarchy. Following the establishment of the CNSC under Xi's leadership,
experts have predicted that the new national security commission may supplant the leadership of the existing
political-legal commission over domestic security issues.409 While the full details of the relationship between the two
Party groups remain unknown, there are several indicators that the political-legal affairs organizations are required to
follow the leadership of the CNSC. First, as previously indicated, the head of the CPLAC is currently a Politburo-level
position, whereas the head of the CNSC is Xi himself. Second, the last available list of the full membership of the
CNSC, which dates from 2017, includes the head of the CPLAC (then Meng Jianzhu) as a member of the CNSC, along with the
Minister of Public Security.410 Third, new regulations released in 2019 require that political-legal work "adhere to the
Comprehensive National Security Concept" and explicitly direct lower-level political-legal committees to "implement the
decisions and arrangements" of central and local national security commission leadership organizations at every
level.411

Personnel Changes

Xi has also gone to great lengths to ensure the loyalty of the political-legal apparatus by replacing most of its
leadership, many by means of the anticorruption campaign, with people he trusts.412 According to Dr. Wu, since taking
power in 2012 Xi has presided over at least three purges of the MPS and political-legal apparatus.413 The first wave
centered around the removal of Zhou Yongkang along with many of Zhou's proteges and much of the leadership of the MPS.
According to Dr. Wu, to accomplish this feat so early in his time as general secretary, Xi relied on support from not
only Wang Qishan (then in charge of the CCP's Central Discipline-Inspection Committee) but also several other groups of
officials both inside and outside the public security apparatus.* 414 Dr. Wu assesses that the ensuing purges in 2018
and 2020 have represented "an ongoing process of power redistribution" among those groups, with each wave bringing to
power individuals with closer ties to Xi than those who had come before.415

The Party under Xi has demonstrated a strong focus on managing and developing the political quality of both the leaders
in the system and the rank-and-file public security personnel. A readout of Xi's guiding speech in January 2015 states,
"It is necessary to strengthen and improve the leadership of political-legal work; choose

to the CCP Central Committee. CCP Central Committee, Plan for Deepening the Reform of Party and State Agencies
(中共中央印发《深化党和国家机构改革方案》), March 21, 2018. Translation.
* These groups were, in order of increasing closeness to Xi: (1) former proteges of Zhou Yongkang who betrayed Zhou in
order to seek patronage from Xi, most of whom already had prominent careers in public security, such as Fu Zhenghua and
Huang Ming; (2) members of the so-called "Shanghai Gang" of officials with close connections to Jiang Zemin and Zeng
Qinghong, most of whom were transferred into the public security system from other areas of the bureaucracy to replace
Zhou and his associates, such as Meng Jianzhu and Guo Shengkun; (3) individuals affiliated with Xi allies like Li
Zhanshu, such as Zhao Kezhi, who were also transferred into public security from other Party positions; and (4) Xi's
longtime associates, such as Wang Xiaohong. Guoguang Wu, "Continuous Purges: Xi's Control of the Public Security
Apparatus and the Changing Dynamics of CCP Elite Politics," China Leadership Monitor, December 1, 2020, 2–3.

and match well the leadership group of political-legal organizations;
continuously raise the ranks' ideological and political quality and
ability to perform their duties; [and] cultivate political-legal ranks
that are loyal to the party, loyal to the country, loyal to the people,
and loyal to the law."416 Later guidance from other leaders echoes
the same themes, emphasizing the importance of both leaders and
the broader ranks below those leaders having strong political qual-
ifications and a good disciplinary record.417 Several Party sources
have mentioned a goal of building the public security forces into a
so-called "iron army" that is immune to corruption.418 A series of
recent activities by an organization called the National Public Se-
curity Ranks Education and Rectification Leading Small Group and
its office confirms this is still an area of attention for the leadership
today.419

Elevation of Xi

Xi's role in remaking and guiding the political-legal apparatus
has been heavily emphasized. As in other policy areas, his speeches
and instructions are consistently used as benchmarks for the correct
policy direction by leaders and organs under him.420 Remarks by
the heads of the CPLAC in 2015 and 2019 credit Xi's instructions
with "point[ing] out the correct direction" and "provid[ing] a grand
blueprint" for political-legal affairs work as well as the guidelines
members of the bureaucracy need in order to "do their jobs well."421
The 2019 regulations on political-legal work make implementing Xi

New Era the first responsibility of political-legal commissions and
committees at all levels.422 In 2021, when CPLAC Secretary Gener-
al Chen Yixin gave a speech outlining ten "key points" that should
serve as a focus for the year ahead, the first goal he highlighted
was the promotion of large-scale learning and training activities to
"set off an upsurge in the study and implementation of Xi Jinping
Thought on the Rule of Law."423

Consequences for Security Decision-Making under Xi

Perhaps more than in any other field, the lack of constraints and
balances on Xi's authority in the security space grants him immense
discretion over the use of China's armed forces. Xi's position at the
intersection of military and Party leadership, his restructuring of
the PLA and paramilitary forces, and his control over personnel de-
cisions grant him a highly streamlined and personalized command.
Consequently, the use and orientation of China's military and para-
military forces are subject to Xi's personal discretion. There are also
features of China's military decision-making system that tend to-
ward micromanagement and potential inefficiency.

Unpredictability in Crisis Management and Escalation
Control

This combination of unparalleled authority and wide discretion
makes it difficult to reliably predict or influence the decisions Xi
will make, particularly in a crisis situation in which he may have
less time or desire to confer with other leaders. As an example, Xi's
centralization of control and personalization of command in the nu-
---
82

clear realm means that should China decide on a launch-on-warning posture,* he alone could have somewhere in the range
of ten minutes to make a personal decision about the use of nuclear weapons, a scenario Mr. Lee described in his
testimony to the Commission as "incredibly concerning." 424

Xi's overwhelming authority further complicates crisis situations by decreasing the likelihood that lower-level
officials or interlocutors have the authority to adapt to changing situations. In his testimony before the Commission,
Dr. Mulvenon expressed concern about the personalization of command under Xi, saying, "If in fact major military
decisions require Xi Jinping's personal approval... rather than an institutional mechanism, that makes crisis
management, escalation control, and strategic communications potentially difficult... during the fog of war. It makes it
more difficult... to establish credible defense telephone links with what we think are the operational elements of the
PLA." 425

Xi's emphasis on the Chairman Responsibility System likely also gives him great discretion over which or how many
subordinates he chooses to consult on major decisions, making it difficult to identify a reliable channel for crisis
messaging. In a time-sensitive situation, there is no guarantee Xi will convene the entire CMC, and higher-ranking CMC
members such as the CMC vice chairmen may be more likely than the Minister of Defense and other CMC members† to still be
consulted.

In this context, the question of information inputs to Xi's decision-making is paramount. Mr. Lee pointed out that the
PLA's relatively well-developed and technologically supported information flows likely present Xi with access to
multiple, diverse sources of information on the same situation at once, including potentially a direct video feed from
relevant tactical formations, which he can use to supplement the reports of any subordinates he chooses to consult.426
From this potential abundance of information, Xi has the broad authority to draw his own conclusions and formulate his
own decisions absent any predictable filter or intervention from other stakeholders.427

----

*A launch-on-warning posture is one in which a state's military would launch nuclear weapons in retaliation for an
incoming strike that has been detected but not yet detonated on its territory. Although China does not currently have a
launch-on-warning posture, many recent advances in the PLA's nuclear capabilities could enable a shift to a
launch-on-warning posture if desired. (For more on China's nuclear doctrine, posture, and capabilities, see U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 3, Section 2, "China's Nuclear Forces: Moving beyond a Minimal
Deterrent," in 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 340–385; U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission, 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 358, 360.

†Specifically, personalization of command under Xi may restrict the ability of the minister of defense, the currently
designated counterpart to the U.S. secretary of defense, to act as a reliable channel to Xi in a crisis scenario. In his
testimony, Dr. Wuthnow assessed that Xi's final decision-making authority means that all CMC members will transmit
messages to him at the top of the system, regardless of the messenger's relative rank on the CMC. This means that in
normal noncrisis scenarios, the minister of defense is likely a viable channel for messaging to Xi by virtue of his CMC
status and his presence at CMC meetings, as is every CMC member. However, Xi's emphasis on the Chairman Responsibility
System likely means he does not necessarily need to convene the entire CMC. If in a crisis scenario, Xi does not have
time or chooses not to convene the entire CMC, the Minister of Defense (currently the third-ranking uniformed member of
the CMC, Wei Fenghe) by virtue of his greater distance from Xi, would be a less reliable channel than the CMC vice
chairmen. Unlike Minister Wei, both CMC vice chairmen also sit on the Politburo, making them the senior defense and
military advisors to the senior-most political leadership of the CCP. Joel Wuthnow, oral testimony for U.S.-China

## Micromanagement of Forces by Senior Leadership

Within China's military there have been longstanding concerns over micromanagement from senior leadership, a trend
exacerbated by the centralization of decision-making under Xi and advances in command and control technology. As Mr. Lee
explains, although the PLA appears to acknowledge warfighters' need for some level of decision-making autonomy on a
theoretical level, the system nonetheless gravitates toward a highly centralized command and control structure.428 The
CMC and theater commands both retain the formal authority to engage in "skip echelon"* command of even tactical
formations and appear to actually use this capability as a matter of course.429 All theater command joint operations
command centers appear to have live video feeds from virtually every weapons platform operating within their areas of
responsibility.430 The upper-level leadership's tendency to push down senior officers to the tactical level appears to
have become problematic enough to interfere with operations.431 To mitigate this interference, the PLA Navy issued new
guidance stipulating that single-ship formations could not have a senior officer embarked onboard, which appears to be
directed at affording the ship's own commander and political officer a chance to perform their job without excessive
oversight.432 According to Dr. Mulvenon's assessment before the Commission, this pervasive culture of micromanagement
creates risk aversion at the lower levels of the PLA and results in "paralysis" whenever they are cut off from
upper-level command.433

## Militarization of Internal Security Actions

Stronger central control over China's paramilitary forces could potentially also contribute to greater internal
instability. The thorough militarization and establishment of central control over the PAP may raise the likelihood that
the central government will conceive of domestic societal concerns in military terms and enforce its domestic agenda
with military force.434 Local governments' loss of ability to independently deploy the PAP may also result in delays and
slower response times to local emergencies.435 Dr. Wuthnow assessed that local governments may hesitate to request
approval from the center to deploy the PAP in emergencies for fear of appearing to have lost control of the
situation.436

### Decision-Making Surrounding a Taiwan Invasion

A decision to take military action over Taiwan is ultimately a political one.437 Xi's preeminent role in China's
military decision-making contributes to dangerous uncertainty† in the Taiwan Strait by making it difficult to predict
the timing of a potential decision to invade Taiwan. As the Commission noted in its 2021 Annual Report, factors such as
a misreading of U.S.

to directly command lower-level units.

Report to Congress, November 2021, 387–438.

84

## Decision-Making Surrounding a Taiwan Invasion—Continued

policy, a belief that a U.S. threat to intervene is not credible, or a focus on Xi's personal ambitions could all
contribute to a deterrence failure whereby the CCP leadership orders the PLA to attack Taiwan. 438 The structural
changes Xi has undertaken to make military decision-making responsive to his direction mean that his personal beliefs
and assessments on these matters could have an outsized or potentially even deciding role in a decision to invade. Xi
possesses broad authority over the military situation by nature of his position as chairman of a restructured CMC, and
he is the only individual on the Politburo Standing Committee with a military portfolio. 439 Compounding this risk, it
is uncertain whether the PLA will truthfully report to Xi about their capabilities and readiness to invade Taiwan, since
it may be politically dangerous to admit to the top leader that the capabilities are not ready after being the focus of
PLA modernization efforts for so long. 440

## Implications for the United States

In the 20 years prior to General Secretary Xi, networks of top leaders and their proteges deliberated policy choices,
and an array of interest groups contributed to decision-making on key policies. Xi has claimed a decisive role for
himself in formulating economic, foreign, and security policy. This reversal from the increasing institutionalization,
state bureaucratic control, and consensus leadership of his predecessors back to central leadership by Party
organization—with Xi at the center of most decision-making bodies—has several implications for how the United States
should manage its competition with China.

The elevation of Xi's personalistic rule means U.S. policymakers can confidently interpret any decision articulated by
Xi as sure to galvanize change in China's policy direction. Because of Xi's overwhelming authority, the substance of
policies directly affiliated with him by name or through his public involvement is relatively unlikely to be subject to
major reinterpretation, even if public messaging around them changes slightly. This may afford a degree of
predictability in China's policy stance, but it also underscores that Xi has a uniquely powerful role in economic,
foreign, and security decision-making. Absent avenues for communication with Xi and his immediate advisers, the United
States may face increased risk.

Because of China's structure as a unified Party-state and the dramatic recentralization of Party control that has
occurred over the last decade, effective diplomatic engagements and communication with China depend upon developing
contact with the people within China's system who hold key Party positions and through those have the authority to make
recommendations and influence policy. This requires looking beyond the government organs that most closely match the
United States' own system and focusing on the positions of influence one holds in the Party structure. The central
management of policymaking by the Party apparatus under Xi means that
---
85

lower-level government interlocutors from State Council ministries likely do not possess great ability to innovate or
make compromises in negotiation. Decisions to adjust course on China's policy choices most likely must be initiated or
approved by either Xi or potentially the head of a relevant Party commission.

Similarly, Xi's unparalleled authority and wide discretion on military affairs make it difficult to reliably predict or
influence the decisions he will make or which interlocutors he will involve in decisions. This is particularly the case
in a crisis situation, when he may have less time or desire to confer with other leaders before making a decision. It
also means external pressure can only be effective if faithfully conveyed to key Party decision-making bodies for
consideration. Typically high-sounding state positions like minister of foreign affairs and minister of defense are a
full step away from the Party leaders making decisions in their areas of responsibility.

The recentralization of decision-making power within the CCP under Xi's leadership accompanies tighter CCP supervision
of the entire Party-state bureaucracy to ensure adherence with Xi's policy choices. As a result, the CCP can ensure
rapid mobilization of resources to advance Xi's policy objectives and execution of his decisions, but it may also limit
the CCP's ability to correct its policy mistakes or adjust course. This inability to adjust course regardless of
economic and security implications poses a challenge to U.S. strategic planning and responses. This may be particularly
relevant in late 2022, when the CCP will reshuffle its leadership. Economic headwinds buffeting the Chinese economy are
occurring just as Xi prepares to extend his leadership over the CCP at the 20th Party Congress. This politically
sensitive year may push Xi to dismiss the economic costs of his policy choices as he looks to protect his position.

Finally, even though the state bodies have always been led by CCP officials and subject to Party guidance, China's
policy increasingly grows out of Party structures and under the auspices of Party leaders who are concerned with
ensuring the Party's continued supremacy. Effective assessments of China's strategic intent must take into account the
worldview and organizational limitations of the CCP as well as the material objectives the Party judges might best suit
"China" as a whole. Furthermore, because all major policy decisions made by Xi are now couched in uncompromising
national security terms, the United States and other countries seeking to defend their own interests in interactions
with China should anticipate and plan for vocal or even coercive retaliation against actions the CCP is likely to
interpret as harmful to its interests.

# Appendix: The CCP's 2022 20th National Congress

## Introduction

- **Party Congress Overview:** The CCP's National Congress, usually referred to simply as the "Party Congress," convenes
every five years to determine the leadership positions within the CCP.*441 As of this report's writing, the CCP's 20th
Party Congress is scheduled to begin on October 16, 2022.442 The event will determine key players in the Party system
and set the tone and agenda for China's policymaking for at least the next five years.443

- **Xi's Intentions for the 20th Party Congress:** At this year's 20th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi likely will
seek to extend his leadership of the CCP, place additional individuals he trusts in positions of power, further elevate
his political profile through amendments to the Party charter, further entrench his policy agenda through speeches and
high-level documents, and continue the process of adjusting institutional arrangements of power within the Party.444

## Party Congress Process

- **Sequence of Events:** The roughly 2,300 delegates† participating in the Party Congress will convene in the Great
Hall of the People in Beijing.445 The delegates will select the new CCP Central Committee and the Central Committee for
Discipline Inspection in a modestly competitive process.‡446 When the selection process is complete, a list of the new
Central Committee Members and Alternate Members will be distributed and circulated to the media.§447

Immediately following the conclusion of the Congress, usually on the following day, the newly selected Central Committee
con-

*The turnover of CCP positions at the Party Congress is only one of the two major events that determine the national
leadership of China's Party-state system. It is followed by the turnover of state positions in the meeting of the
National People's Congress in the next spring. Thus, the process of leadership turnover begun at the 20th Party Congress
in the fall of 2022 will not be completed until the conclusion of the National People's Congress in March 2023. Yew Lun
Tian, "Factbox: How China's Communist Party Congress Works," Reuters, October 14, 2022; Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee,
"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress," Congressional Research Service,
November 24, 2021, 23.

†According to Xinhua, delegates represent 38 provinces and other provincial-level entities (autonomous regions,
centrally administered municipalities, and special administrative regions), certain central authorities, the central
financial sector, and Beijing-based centrally administered state-owned enterprises. The election process for delegates
includes five steps Xinhua describes as "the nomination of candidates by Party members; a nominee review; public
notification of the candidates for feedback; candidate shortlists; and the final vote in each electoral unit." Xinhua,
"How CPC Elects Delegates to Upcoming Party Congress," April 23, 2022.

‡At the CCP's last Party Congress in October 2017, delegates selected 204 candidates out of a list of 222 for full
membership on the Central Committee. Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, "China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before
the 20th Party Congress," Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 9–10.

§According to Susan Lawrence, specialist in Asian Affairs at the Congressional Research Service, if Xi's name is
included in this list of Central Committee Members, it is an indication he will likely be selected for a third term as
CCP general secretary, as the position of general secretary can only be held by a member of the Central Committee. If
Xi's name does not appear on this list, it is an advance indication that he will not retain the position of general
secretary. This could mean either that he is expected to step down entirely or that he will take a different approach to
remaining in power that does not require him to be a member of the Central Committee. This was the approach taken by
Jiang Zemin in 2002 when he relinquished the position of general secretary to Hu Jintao but retained the position of CMC
chairman. Susan Lawrence, remarks at "Toward Xi's Third Term: China's 20th Party Congress and Beyond," January 20, 2022,

venes its first plenary session.448 It is at this meeting that the new Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee, general
secretary, and CMC are selected.449 After the conclusion of the Central Committee's first plenary session, the newly
selected Politburo Standing Committee, headed by the general secretary, have in the past been revealed in rank order at
a live, televised press conference.450

- Indicators of Xi's Influence on the Process: At the 17th and 18th Party Congresses in 2007 and 2012, Hu Jintao's
Administration conducted straw polls for Central Committee members to express their opinions on candidates for the
Politburo.451 Although the results of these polls were secret and nonbinding, they reportedly did influence the ultimate
selection of Politburo members.452 At the 19th Party Congress, by contrast, Xi replaced straw polls with face-to-face
consultations.453 Given an emphasis in Party media on the delegates' need to uphold Xi's position as the core of the
Central Committee and the Party, Xi may have used his influence to adjust the process in his favor in the runup to the
20th Party Congress.454

## Outcomes to Watch in 2022

- Xi's Position and Title: The most visible and consequential outcome of the 20th Party Congress will be a determination
of Xi's status as the top leader of the CCP. Xi is widely expected to break with recent precedent and remain at the head
of the CCP beyond the 20th Party Congress,* potentially securing a third term as CCP general secretary. Some analysts
have even suggested Xi may use the occasion of the 20th Party Congress to claim the position of "CCP chairman," which
was abolished shortly after the death of Mao Zedong.455 Any continuation of Xi's leadership would likely presage a
continuation and intensification of his existing policy agenda. His resignation or removal would mark a significant
shift in China's political landscape.

- Succession: In the event Xi remains the Party's top leader, another important outcome will be whether he identifies
one or more potential successors. At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi broke with recent precedent by not
indicating any presumptive successors.† 456 Continued silence on this issue at the 20th Party Congress would intensify
existing concerns about the potential for instability in the hypothetical event of Xi's untimely demise or departure
from power.457 It may also provide clues into Xi's intended tenure at the top of the system or his level of confidence
in his political control.‡

*The position of CCP general secretary does not have an explicit term limit, but Xi's two immediate predecessors, Jiang
Zemin and Hu Jintao, served only two five-year terms. By this precedent, Xi, who became general secretary in 2012, would
be expected to step down at the 20th Party Congress in 2022. Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, "China's Political System in
Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress," Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 11.

†Xi was identified alongside Li Keqiang as one of Hu Jintao's two presumptive successors at the 17th Party Congress in
2007, which began Hu's second term as general secretary. Hu was similarly anointed as the "heir apparent" to his
predecessor Jiang Zemin in 1992. Congressional Research Service, "China's 17th Communist Party Congress, 2007:
Leadership and Policy Implications," EveryCRSReport.com, December 5, 2007; Cheng Li, "China: Riding Two Horses at Once,"
Brookings Institution, October 23, 2007.

‡The meaning of this decision could nonetheless be interpreted multiple ways. A decision not to designate any successors
could be interpreted as a signal of Xi's confidence and his intention
---
88

- Appointments: Appointments to the CCP's Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee will likely reveal key supporters
of the CCP top leader. Assessing the level of adherence to informal retirement and promotional norms for these senior
positions could also provide clues about the top leader's political capital to advance his allies.

- Politburo Standing Committee: Most new appointments to the Politburo Standing Committee have historically come from
the ranks of the previous Politburo.^458 From within the Politburo, male, nonmilitary members below the prevailing
retirement age have accounted for most of the promotions.^* ^459 Appointments at the 20th Party Congress that do not
conform to these trends would be particularly notable. In particular, younger leaders "helicoptered" to the Politburo
Standing Committee without first serving on the Politburo are relatively likely to be targeted for serving in a top
leadership position in the future. For example, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping, and Li Keqiang were all elevated from the Central
Committee to the Politburo Standing Committee in this way in 1992 and 2007.^460

- Politburo: Most new appointments to the Politburo have historically been members of the previous Central
Committee.^461 A few individuals have also been elevated to the Politburo directly from the lower-ranking position of
Central Committee Alternate Member, skipping the intermediary step of Central Committee Member.^462 At Xi's last Party
Congress in 2017, two new Politburo members came from outside the Central Committee entirely, and both had personal ties
to Xi.^463 Any further promotions of Central Committee Alternate Members or individuals without experience in the
Central Committee at the 20th Party Congress would be noteworthy.

- Retirement Ages: Because expected retirement ages for CCP leadership positions† are informal norms that have been
adjusted and manipulated by top leaders over time, appointments that contravene these prevailing norms are notable when
they occur. At the 20th Party Congress, the selection of any individual aged 68 or above to serve on the Politburo or
Politburo Standing Committee likely indicates a particular interest in

to remain China's top leader beyond the 21st Party Congress in 2027. Conversely, even if Xi does plan to step down in
2027, he may still refrain from publicly anointing a successor if he has concerns that doing so could provide a platform
for that individual to challenge him prematurely. A decision to appoint a successor or successors could be a sign that
Xi feels pressure from other leaders to identify an end date to his rule, or it could indicate he is confident enough in
his political control that the identification of an eventual successor does not threaten his position in the interim.

^* No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee. There are also very few recent historical cases of
uniformed military officers in the Politburo moving up to the Politburo Standing Committee level. Susan Lawrence and
Mari Lee, "China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress," Congressional Research
Service, November 24, 2021, 13; Joseph Fewsmith, Rethinking Chinese Politics, Cambridge, 2021, 79–80; Alice Miller,
"Projecting the Next Politburo Standing Committee," Hoover Institution, March 1, 2016, 1, 4–5, 7.

† At the 15th Party Congress in 1997, the age limit to serve on the Politburo was 69 (with individuals aged 70 or older
expected to retire). Since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, the age limit has been 67 (with no individuals aged 68 or
older continuing to serve). Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, "China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th
Party Congress," Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 11; Alice Miller, "Projecting the Next Politburo
Standing Committee," Hoover Institution, March 1, 2016, 1.

that individual by the top leader. Similarly, a lowering of the retirement age may suggest a desire by the top leader to
prevent the advancement of one or more individuals within the age band disqualified by the change.

- Party Charter: In the past, the CCP has used the occasion of the Party Congress to add references to the top leaders'
personal contributions to Party doctrine into the CCP Charter.* 464 Xi's signature contribution, Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and BRI were included in the Party charter at the 19th Party
Congress in 2017.465 Any additional changes that highlight the status of Xi's contributions would signal a further
elevation of his personal status in the Party.466

- Speeches and Reports: The CCP's political work report† is an extremely important indicator of the new leadership's
policy priorities that sets the tone for the next five years.467 After the conclusion of the Party Congress, speeches
and public statements by newly selected CCP leaders are also important to observe. In the event Xi retains his
leadership of the Party, the level of emphasis his major initiatives and policy slogans receive in these high-level
statements will provide clues about his political standing and intentions following the Party Congress.

----

*Similar adjustments to the text of the PRC Constitution are generally made at the National People's Congress the
following spring.

†The political work report summarizes the accomplishments of the previous Central Committee leadership and is
traditionally presented by the previous general secretary at the opening of the Party Congress. It informs resolutions
passed at the Party Congress itself and acts as an indicator of future policy priorities. Yew Lun Tian, "Factbox: How
